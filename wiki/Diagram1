A diagram is a two-dimensional geometric (can be three-dimensional also) symbolic representation of information according to some visualization technique.<s>They have been used since ancient times but became more prevalent during the Enlightenment.<s>Sometimes, the technique uses a three-dimensional visualization which is then projected onto the two-dimensional surface.<s>The word graph is sometimes used as a synonym for diagram.<s>== Overview ==
The term diagram in its commonly used sense can have a general or specific meaning:
visual information device : Like the term "illustration" the diagram is used as a collective term standing for the whole class of technical genres, including graphs, technical drawings and tables.<s>specific kind of visual display : This is the genre that shows qualitative data with shapes that are connected by lines, arrows, or other visual links.<s>In science the term is used in both ways.<s>For example Anderson (1997) stated more generally: "diagrams are pictorial, yet abstract, representations of information, and maps, line graphs, bar charts, engineering blueprints, and architects' sketches are all examples of diagrams, whereas photographs and video are not".<s>On the other hand Lowe (1993) defined diagrams as specifically "abstract graphic portrayals of the subject matter they represent".<s>In the specific sense diagrams and charts contrast with computer graphics, technical illustrations, infographics, maps, and technical drawings, by showing "abstract rather than literal representations of information".<s>The essence of a diagram can be seen as:
a form of visual formatting devices
a display that does not show quantitative data (numerical data), but rather relationships and abstract information
with building blocks such as geometrical shapes connected by lines, arrows, or other visual links.<s>Or in Hall's (1996) words "diagrams are simplified figures, caricatures in a way, intended to convey essential meaning".<s>These simplified figures are often based on a set of rules.<s>The basic shape according to White (1984) can be characterized in terms of "elegance, clarity, ease, pattern, simplicity, and validity".<s>Elegance is basically determined by whether or not the diagram is "the simplest and most fitting solution to a problem".<s>== Main diagram types ==
There are at least the following types of diagrams:
Graph-based diagrams: these take a collection of items and relationships between them, and express them by giving each item a 2D position, while the relationships are expressed as connections between the items or overlaps between the items; examples of such techniques:
Chart-like diagram techniques, which display a relationship between two variables that take either discrete or a continuous ranges of values; examples:
Schematics and other types of diagrams, e.g.,
Many of these types of diagrams are commonly generated using diagramming software.<s>Thousands of diagram techniques exist.<s>Some more examples follow.<s>== Specific diagram types ==
