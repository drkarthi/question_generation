In this case it shows example of one entity, one attribute and one relationship.<s> This justgives the name.<s> The data dictionary is typically organized like this,  it could haveadditional column which represent the author for example.<s> Not the author of the table butthe person who actually came up with this particular data dictionary entity.<s> That is whatwe are referring to.<s> It says the article is an entity it was put in here and the details of thisgives the details of the published article that can be ordered using the LIBSYS system.<s> Inthe case of the author it is an attribute of the article.<s> It can also be an entity by itself andthat can also be stated here.<s> That is both an attribute of an article as well as an entity byitself.<s> The fee payable is the relationship; it is a 1 to 1 relationship between the article andthe source and so on.<s> This is an example of a data dictionary.<p>

And the data dictionary is often something that is shared with multiple subsystems withina software application.<s> so that is as far as the structural details of data goes,  but oftentoday what is happening is a lot of the systems that are being built are constructed in whatis called a object oriented technology or an object oriented method of development andthis has its own set of models that brings into play.<s> (Refer Slide Time: 43:20)<p>

Instead of starting from the data, what object orientation allows us to do is to encapsulatedata with the functionality that goes along with the data.<s> For example you do not just saythat this is an order and the order has these different data fields.<s> But there are things thatyou can do to an order.<s> For example you can create the order, you can enhance the order,you can validate the order, and you can check it out whether it has been serviced and soon.<s> Every entity by itself is associated with the state diagram, which it can go to differentstates and there are different functions that can be performed on it.<s> What object modelstry to do?<s> There are different perspectives of even the object model.<s> But they try toencapsulate a bind together the data and the associated data operations that go along withthe data.<p>

Another good example of an object could be something like a camera.<s> A  camera forexample has data associated with it.<s> The make, the manufacturer, the kind of lens that ithas, the kind of zoom capability it has so on.<s> There are certain things that you can do toit.<s> You can operate the camera, you can change the batteries in the camera, and you canload the film,  remove film out of the camera so on.<s> Various object models can beproduced.<s> An  object model very similar to the entity relationship diagram can beproduced.<s> In this case, these do not represent data entries but these represent objects.<p>
