The customer and publisher entities are carried over from the previous diagram.<s> We havecreated a few data stores also which will be required by these processes in order tocarryout the processing.<s> We must remember that lot of data needs to be stored in thisapplication and therefore some data stores will have to be identified from one refinementto another refinement.<s> Let us  again understand this diagram in terms of what exactly ishappening here.<p>

We receive an  order from the customer.<s> The first thing would be to verify that we areaccepting a proper order.<s> Verification  consists  of checking the credit rating of thiscustomer, because we are supplying him against which we will receive payment in future.So we must be sure about the credit rating of this customer and we keep a data base ofpast customers.<s> We  also keep their record that they have been paying regularly.<s> So wegive them some credit rating.<s> Credit rating is obtained from the customer data store.<s> Thebook details are obtained from book data store.<s> We verify that and  the order can beaccepted  when  it is coming from customers who are having good credit rating with usand it is for books we are dealing with and we verify the order and we create a data storecalled pending orders.<p>

Pending orders will contain the orders which have been accepted.<s> We do not show therejected orders because that is an exception which can always be incorporated in therequired processing.<s> These pending orders are periodically picked up by the assembleorder process.<s> This assemble order receives a batch of pending orders and it also receivesthe data from publishers data store.<s> These books which the customer wants to buy,  wehave to find out the publishers and for that publisher and for this bunch of orders we willassemble the order for the publisher.<s> This purchase order is then send to the publisher andthe details of the purchase order are also stored  in  purchase orders data store.<s> Thepublisher will then send the shipment details to us.<s> Those shipment details will be firstverified against our own purchase order.<p>

The verify shipment is a process which validates the shipment notice that we receivefrom the publisher against our own order that we had sent to him.<s> After the shipment isprocessed, we have a process  which will assemble the consignments for the customer.We have their pending orders with us and we have now received the material.<s> So we willform a shipment to the customers.<s> This shipment  will be as per the shipping note.<s> Thisshipping note will be sent out to the customer.<s> It will of course go to our internal dispatchsection that will send the books as well.<s> These are the four processes which carry out theorder processing for the Book Agent application.<s> Together they complete the processingand we have also identified important data stores for the same.<s> Now we are going toexplode the process 2 which was shown in the previous data flow diagram where we arepreparing the purchase orders for the publishers.<s> What are the sub processes of process 2?<p>
