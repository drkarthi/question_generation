Now validation is the question of Are we the building the right product?<s> That is, does itreally help the user do what they want to do?For example if you have a document editor of some kind, let us say it is a word processorand you do not have a spell check built in to that at all.<s> This may be an issue which is amissed out requirement and these are the kind of question that you will try to answer withthe validation process.So you  will  go back to user scenarios in the first place and see whether whatever youended up building at the end of the day, really meets the user scenario that were laid outto begin with.This is also process that has to be  applied across the  lifecycle.<s> So we cannot  just doverification and validation at the end of the life cycle and hope that everything is going tohave come out right at that point in time, because what if did not?<s> - is the question.<p>

The cost of fixing something let us say that you missed out a requirement and let us saythat you did not conform to the specification because you misunderstood it in some way,then the cost of finding that out in the end of the cycle is very high and the cost of fixingit  is also high.<s> The earlier you catch that problem and fix  it will be  cheaper for thesoftware development process.So it is a whole life cycle process in other words.<s> It cannot just be done towards the endand it has to be applied towards every state within the process.<p>
