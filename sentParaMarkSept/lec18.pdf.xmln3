Are you able to get the right value as an output of this function?<s> For these criteria, theseare some chosen values.<s> In your test case you must have some concrete values.<s> Forexample x and y same: There could be many possibilities,  but you have chosen onespecific set of values.<s> For x and y: (10, 10) For x greater than y, you have chosen x to be10 and y to be 8.<s> For  y greater than x, you have chosen y to be 2 and x to be 25.<s> Nowgiven these three tests,  your function works correctly,  that does not mean that thefunction will work correctly for all set of inputs.<s> But you have now validated thefunctions against these three cases and your confidence in the software or in the functionwill go up if it works correctly for these three cases.<p>

Now we can ask these two questions: What criteria should be used to design test cases?How are you going to design these test cases?<s> We identify three criteria here, which arewith respect to the values,  their types and also probably the semantics or the context,what should be the ranges of the values and so on.<s> So what are those different criteria thatcould be used to design the test cases and what should be tested?<s> In the above  case thefunction has been tested.<s> But what else can we test?<s> Now we are going to look at someanswers for these questions in the course of this lecture today.<s> Let  us look at the firstquestion.<s> What criteria should we use?<s> Should the testing be done based on externalobservable behavior of the software or should one see the code to design the test cases?<p>

For example, we saw the use case based test plan.<s> We had seen only, what is observablefrom outside and design a test case based on what is observable.<s> But then should we notlook into the actual code, the statements, and the structure of the code and design the testcases?<s> This is an important question that can give us two major classes or majorapproaches to testing.<s> So  one looks at the external view of the software or of a givenartifact and the other looks at the internal view, which  means you are going to test thesoftware based on what is there inside the software, what  is the code, the  specificstatement, and it could be the conditions and so on and so forth.<p>

The  two  major categories that we derive from this question are black box testing andwhite box testing.<s> We can see here that black box testing is based on what is requiredfrom external point of view.<s> So you are looking at the software units or artifacts as blackboxes you do  not see them inside.<s> You are going to take an external view or a usersview.<s> If you are looking at the entire software as a black box you are going to use the userinterface and test the software.<s> If you are going to look at one module inside the softwareas a black box,  you are not going to see inside that module.<s> But at the same time youhave to test the module and you will have to generate some input parameters to themodule and generate the context of the module.<p>
