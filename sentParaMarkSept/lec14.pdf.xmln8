We now know the different ways of decomposition.<s> Now we will move on tocomposition.<s> What about composition, interconnection or collaboration and coupling?How do modules correspond with each other?<s> What is the best way for them tocorrespond with each other?<s> Should they interact with each other too much or should youminimize that or should there be no interaction?<s> Without interaction how can theycollaborate?<p>

How can you have a system with many modules?<s> How good is a given modulardecomposition?<s> What is the goodness property?<s> There are metrics to measure thegoodness of design.<s> There are different ways for modules  to  interact.<s> You can havefunctional interfaces, you can have processes, you can have sockets, or you have remotemethod invocations or you have services on internet, or you can call functions, there arerecursions etc.<s> There are different ways of interaction and some of these have been listedhere.<p>

There could be peer to peer interaction A  communicates with B and  B  alsocommunicates with A.<s> A can send a message to B and B can also send a messageto  A.<s> This is not about just reply.<s> This is a message that originates and asks for aservice.<s> A  asks  for  Bs  service and B  asks  for  As  service.<s> That  is peer to peer way ofconnecting.<p>

You can have client server model for interconnection.<s> The  client asks  the server toprovide specific service.<s> They send out the message and get the reply in return.<s> You canhave  specialization-generalization for interconnection.<s> Inheritance,  aggregation for partwhole, you have different ways of messaging, message queues, sockets and black boards.You have synchronization methods  such as,  signaling,  semaphore,  monitor  etc.<s> Hence,there are  different ways  of interconnecting system or composing them.<s> Once you havedecomposed,  you have to connect them.<s> So composition and decomposition,  ordecomposition and then the composition of the decomposed modules or the entities,interconnections in the collaborations among them are very important.<s> There are differentways of making them collaborate and there are different ways of connecting them.<s> Thosehave to be considered in your design.<s> Now we will look at the basic principles that youapply during the design.<p>
