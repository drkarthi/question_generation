If you look at the slide again you say the motivation behind having an integrated model isto provide one model across the entire lifecycle.<s> That  means  there is a  means ofintegrating multiple assessment activities, training and so on and so forth.<p>

(Refer Slide Time: 10:51)<p>

So, different models can be clubbed together to form a new model.<s> So we have CMMIsoftware and systems  version  1.02  and  the  ultimate aim is to have a CMMI whichintegrates four  norm models software  systems,  getting the product done and acquisitionof the product etc.<p>

Therefore sub-contracting,  acquisition,  system engineering,  software all these things ifwe  put together under a common model then an organization need not have multiplemodels that it follows for a different purpose.<s> A common model will suit the requirementand obviously in the common model we will ignore those particular aspects of the modelwhich are not relevant for a specific project and those can be ruled out.<s> So another majoradvantage is that the assessment method for the  Capability Maturity Model will also beuniform.<p>

So if you look at the slide again we can have SCAMPI the Standard CMMI AssessmentMethod for Process Improvement as a method which is used for assessing each particularorganization on the CMMI that is whichever particular phase we  are trying to work on.When SCI went from CMM software to CMMI obviously a lot of good things from othermodels came in and probably other segments benefited from the practices followed in thesoftware kind of area.<p>
