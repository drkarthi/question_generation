The process is something that we will go into next.<s> It can just be fitted into the existingsoftware engineering process in the sense that you have a requirement stage and once thespecification is done you typically have a design phase.<p>

Now,  here is where reuse really  comes into the picture;  you can either reuse it at itsspecification phase but more often than not reuse starts in the design phase and is mostheavy during the implementation phases.<s> So, given that what typically happens is you cansay that you will extend the normal software engineering lifecycle to  essentially have areuse activity within the process.<s> By this what we mean is that you have a design phasebut as part of the design phase you first go look for components  and if components areavailable then you just reuse them and then you design the rest of the system and go on;the same thing for implementation.<p>

However, one should realize that this may not work very optimally.<s> So, for example, youmight go find a component whose  specifications  do  not  exactly match the designrequirements that you have,  whose  specifications do  not  exactly  match theimplementation needs that you may have so it may be little bit more than what is requiredor it may be a little bit less than what is required.<p>
