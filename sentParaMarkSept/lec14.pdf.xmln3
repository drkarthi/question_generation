If you have designed for a specific protocol,  you can simply take that design if theprotocol is recurring.<s> You have to benefit from your old design.<s> There are mechanismsfor reuse.<s> There is a separate discussion on design patterns.<s> Design patterns are the objectoriented design which can be reused again and again for different domains in differentapplications.<s> For example,  you have a  common design requirement that customerssubscribe or consumers subscribe and the  publishers publish the results or publish  theevents.<s> Whenever something is published,  the subscribers must get the results of thepublication or the events are to be delivered.<p>

If there are services built for example abstraction service, it looks at different newspapersand then it gives you an abstract of what has happened today to the subscriber.<s> This is acommon requirement that there are publishers and subscribers.<s> If you have encounteredsuch requirements in a  design earlier in another project and if this recurs  in a differentnew project, then  you have to  now use the results  of your earlier design and directlyapply it in the new project.<s> The names of the entities might be different.<s> There might bespecialized behavior,  but you should be able to make use of most of what you havealready encountered.<s> So  object orientation does allow you to reuse lot of your designideas and there is a nice book by the gang of four authors (Design patterns: elements ofreusable object-oriented software).<s> Erich Gamma  is the one who actually initiated  thisbook.<p>
