So, for instance, people working in software development of Tata Consultancy Servicesand people working in software development  department of Life Insurance Corporationof India  may or may not have the same parameter values for  doing the development ormaintaining the systems.<s> Also, you are not in a position to handle exceptional situationsusing this kind of approach.<s> This kind of  approach is good when you have knownsituations.<s> Suppose the technology has changed, it is very difficult for you to use the olddata and use it for the proposed project.<s> There are certain problems of this particular kindand those particular problems can be solved otherwise by using different approaches.<s> Letus  now look  at  making  estimation for the software development part of the softwareproject.<p>

Many  of the components like training,  convergence  all those for the timing less  bypassthem  and  look at how you  make estimates for the software development project.<s> Nowyou say whom do we make these estimates for?It is a basis or agreement for all concerned.<s> So let us take for instance three major stakeholders; the customer, the top management of the project manager and the team memberand what we need to do is to make estimates for these people so that we can work closelywith them.<s> Now the purpose and the details of estimation in all the three cases are not thesame.<s> Obviously from that point of view the estimates are done at different points of timeand  information available at that point of time is different.<s> So obviously the techniquesthat we would use for doing the estimations will also vary.<p>

First, look at the project manager and the customer relationship.<s> Now,  if you look littlebefore the project started the  customer needs a single estimate for the total amount oftime and effort required for completing this particular project.<s> That is basically your inputto bidding.<s> Now this aspect of project management of verifying the estimation isconsistent with the marketing support that you need to provide for making the estimates.<p>
