Every change that is made to the software introduced  via  change request has to beschedule  for some particular release.<s> every release can be tagged with a particularnumber,  for example,  you release 3.0  of the system today which is a  major releasetypically and 3.1 is a minor release that contain bunch of features, 3.15 may be of a patchrelease that basically fixes some errors in the software and these errors or changes mayhave come in from change request or  may  have  come in from the user who reportederrors or errors that were discovered during additional testing and so on.<p>

So  release planning is the next step that is done after impact analysis and as soon asrelease planning is  done then the implementation of the change can take place  and theimplementation of  the change does  not  necessarily mean that which is going to bestraightaway start writing the code; it could well be that a design review have to be heldto be saying that this module is changing or we are appropriately considering the effecton the different interfaces;  how are we  going to effect this  change,  for example, thenotion of the business rules  engine  that I talked about; fairly a  major change can alsocome in through a change request but this is going to necessitate a design review to takeplace for example that is something you would have to think about and finally once youimplement  it then you will release it; it is the release process itself and the process ofrelease itself can introduce new changes so this could be a cycle.<p>
