The second point that is important here is, the reuse domain and programming knowledgethat exists and  reviewers  are  likely  to have  seen the types of errors that are commonlycommitted.<s> For example,  one  of  the things that are commonly done in coding  is that, avariable is not initialized  before it is used and so this is something that people know towatch out for when they are doing an inspection.<s> As result  of which  they are likely tocatch it pretty quickly.<p>

Other thing may be coding standards  that are set up by the organization.<s> Typically acoding standard may say that there is a certain naming nomenclature that has to be usedor a nomenclature that has to be used throughout the program.So, for example module/method are named by interCap notations could be a particularcoding standard and violation of that can be easily be caught by people because they havebeen doing this for a long time and they know exactly what to look for in this particularcase.<p>

So once again  inspections  and testing are  complementary process.<s> They are  notsomething that is  mutually exclusive, so both of them have to be done.<s> Inspections aretypically applied  at a higher level of design.<s> It can be applied to code,  in fact in somecases it is applied, but it is not trying to catch code errors such as the infinite loop of aprogram etc.<s> Typically,  it is meant  to catch design errors that  of a higher level just likethe security design error that we just saw a little while ago.<s> And both of them obviouslyhave to be used during entire process.<p>

So inspections are something that can check conformance with a specification.<s> Actuallythe  third bullet in the above screen is not completely  true in the sense that,  inspectionscan understand the true intent  of the customer when they specified  the requirement.Because there are humans involved who are sometimes doing these inspections, whereastesting is typically automated.<s> It  is an automated process and you have written  the testand it is hard to understand.<s> So in testing, you are going exactly as per the specificationand you may not be able to understand the true intent the customer when they specify therequirement.So, in that case again inspections can check the conformance with the specification andalso it can go beyond that.<s> It can be used in a situation where in there is a human in theteam basically an architect,  there is a business analyst, system analyst who understandswhat the customer meant  when they  wrote down a particular requirement.<s> In that casethey can bring that knowledge to bear on the inspection process and make that to be thatmuch more useful.The disadvantages of inspection are, obviously it cannot test non functional requirements.So, it cannot test user friendliness, it cannot test performance, it cannot test reliability andso on.<s> This is because they are not actually playing with the software at that point in time.They are not executing the software, they are not executing the code in order to test for aparticular property.<s> Whereas in testing you can catch them and there can be test for nonfunctional requirements as well.A test for example that will measure the end to end response time of a particular requestand if it exceeds  the threshold,  you know that you have broken a non functionalrequirement very clearly.<s> But that cannot be done during the inspection process.<s> Howeverthere can be hints that the particular piece of program code or a particular design is goingto be too resource intensive.In other words,  say you can make out that an  algorithm that is going to be used  inencryption is far too CPU intensive, so given a fact that there could be a hundreds of userbanking on the system simultaneously, then that is the not the right algorithm to be used.That kind of a decision making can be done with inspection process much earlier on inthe life cycle.So program inspections are basically formalized approach.<s> They are intended to explicitlycheck for defect detection and certainly it is not going to help correct  it,  but  all thosesuggestions  may come out during the inspection process as on  how to correct theparticular defect.And typically we are looking for high level logical errors, we looking for design flaws,we looking for architectural suggestions,  the choice of particular component,  and thechoice of particular data structure on a certain situation and so on.<p>
