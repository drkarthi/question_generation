So if the system is a real time kind of a system where it is processing online transactions,then we need to define the throughput and the response time.<s> Consider the example of saybanking, when the banking software has to accept transactions from the customers.<s> Thenwe need to  identify,  in how much time the system must react to the input of thetransaction.<s> Or totally in a particular given time which may be the peak time, how manytransactions should the system process in a given slot, which could be one hour or something.<s> So these are the capacity requirements which are important to be specified and theyare specified from the users point of view.<s> And these are defined by taking into account,what are the actual requirements of the organization.<p>

So after identifying these,  we identify the various design constraints.<s> Now theseconstraints may be in terms of the development standards.<s> The organization may havevery specific standards for developing the software.<s> Or it may be standards for variousreports.<s> For example in the financial world lot of reports are required by  regulatoryauthorities.<s> So these reports must be as per the standards.<s> Then there are auditingrequirements.<s> So these standards needs to be complied with and those must be clearlyidentified and they are identified in this section.<p>

We also identify any hardware limitations.<s> For example the user may have already somemachines,  operating  systems;  database systems etc  and we may need to develop thesoftware for the available environment.<s> So these would be treated as hardware constraintsor system constraints.<s> And finally we state any other requirements possibly mentionedhere the future extensions for the software.<s> This is the overall format for the SRSdocument which is giving a complete specification of the software in terms of what itwould contain.<s> We must note here that all sections which are listed here may not berequired in all projects, because some projects may be very small in scope.<s> But in mostcases, these different sections would be necessary because they cover various aspects notonly the functions, but they cover constraints, they define functional requirements, theydefine performance requirements.<p>
