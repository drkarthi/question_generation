So,  for example,  there could be one interface on list that says  append to the list  andincrease the count of the elements in the list and so on and so forth but there could be itcould be replaced  by two single operations:  one that increases the count of elements inthe list and one that just appends the particular item that is being added to the list so thatis  because the understandability of individual operation goes up significantly andtherefore the understandability of the component a the whole goes up as well.<p>

Always write components that have customizable behavior for error condition.<s> this is thenotion of exception; writing a lot of exceptions within the interface of the component andmaking sure that if  you cannot handle certain situations then there is a well-definedexception that is going to go back up it is not to ripple up and the user of the componentcan take evasive or corrective action on that particular exception as well.<p>

The last tip here is to generalize some several instances.<s> If the first time you are writing acomponent,  if you say.<s> Oh..!<s> I can make it generate and immediately go ahead andcreate a reusable component  out of  that  it  is likely that  the  situations for reuse thepotential for reuse may not even exist.<s> but if, on the other hand, if you find out that youare using a  similar  component  over and over again in a particular project or acrossdifferent projects  that is the time to actually a  create component out of it,  a  reusablecomponent out of it.<s> So  do  not  generisize  it  on the first try always wait  for empiricalevidence that this component is indeed going to be useful across multiple situations andwhen you run across two or three  such situations  that is the time to make this a trulyreusable  component.<s> The  other important thing about reusability is to generate a goodmental model about the component.<p>

So,  the client or the person who is going to use this component in the construction ofanother application needs to have a good feel for the component that is the only time theyare is going to reuse it and here are some guidelines for creating good mental models ofcomponents as well so specifications have to be very well written for components.<p>
