Now how will you go about doing this in our particular project?We start with our three programs and giving a  little twist to the particular matter  let usassume that each of these particular programs  can be done in  two  parts.<s> First particularpart  is to do the specification and the design and the other is to do coding and testing.Many times you find that coding and testing and the specification writing are dependenton each other but the subsequent programs may only depend on the specification part ofthe earlier program and not necessarily on the coding and testing of that particularprogram.<s> So we are now sure that we have two parts of the update program and we haveanother two parts for  the query program and we have another two parts  for  the reportprogram.<s> So three programs  have  been  split into six activities,  their  precedencerelationships have been identified here and then we do the integration.<s> Now the designerwill have to decide how to integrate the system.<p>

But from our point of view let us assume for simplicity sake that we have decided that wewill do the integration in steps.<s> First we will integrate the update program with the queryprogram and then the update program and the report program and then we will integrateall of them together at the time of system testing and of course the acceptance testing.Now here we need to make some assumptions.<p>
