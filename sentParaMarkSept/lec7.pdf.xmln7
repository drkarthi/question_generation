One of the things that we may ask ourselves is that what about concrete realization ofthis.<s> So far we have taken look at describing very abstract representation of what a stackdata type is.<s> But how are we going to convert this into a programmatic entity that canactually  be used in an application.<s> Typically there is a very clean mapping betweenabstract data types and object oriented data structures.<s> This is something that we willprobably see during the later part of the course when we described object oriented design.<p>

Object oriented data structures allow us to map these abstract data types very cleanly onto them and these are called classes.<s> You must have read about this class in objectoriented programming.<s> Classes  can either be deferred classes.<s> They are deferred in thesense they are partially implemented,  or there can be effective classes or fullyimplemented classes.<s> Depending on how much of concreteness you want to give yourselfat a particular point in  time,  then we can go for deferred class or an abstract class.<s> Theaxioms that we saw in the stack essentially can be very simply stated in English as well.It could have been stated in a natural language but we chose to write it down in analgebraic specification.<p>

For example, one of the axioms is that the new stack is always empty.<s> We wrote it downin a formal manner saying IS EMPTY (NEW STACK)  equals true.<s> But a naturallanguage specification that would simply be that the new stack is always empty and whenyou push an element on to the new stack then the top of the stack has to always containthe single element that you have pushed on to the stack.<s> These things what you can see isthe mathematical models that may have created using algebraic specifications in this caseare a very powerful concise notation.<s> Remember the characteristic of formalspecifications that we talked about last time.<s> One of them is,  it has to be complete, andthe second thing was it has to be concise, the third thing was it has to be correct and therewere no ambiguities about it and so on.<s> Those properties as you can see are pretty wellsatisfied by the algebraic specifications of the stack that we just sorted out.<p>
