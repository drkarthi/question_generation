In this fashion, we can see that the specs drive the test plan and the test plan drives thespecs.<s> So modification in the specs causes a change in the test plan and a change in thetest plan might also cause modification on the specs, if you are adding new features or ifyou are identifying something new from the specs point of view or new constraints andnew features and so on.<s> So testing is useful to find errors and an early plan of the testingcan help refine your specifications.<s> And  afterwards,  when the software is  built,  whenyour modules start appearing,  testing has to be carried out.<s> So the plan has to beimplemented and carried out.<p>

We will now see different aspects of testing,  various high level strategies.<s> This is anexample test case.<s> Here we are trying to find out what a test case  is.<s> A  test case isdescribed through a choice of inputs for the unit to be tested.<p>

So given a unit, you want to test that unit and you want to identify what are the inputs forthe test case.<s> And along with the test case of course you have to also know what aregoing to be the expected results of the test case.Now we have given a few examples on this slide about a suite of test cases for a givenfunction.<s> So you have a function int f () that takes 2 input parameters x and y.<s> This is Csyntax.<s> The function f takes two parameters x and y and the function compares the twoinput numbers and it reports the maximum.<s> What should be your test suite?<s> How are yougoing to test this function?<s> For example you could have these three criteria: When x andy is same, x is greater than y and y is greater than x.<p>
