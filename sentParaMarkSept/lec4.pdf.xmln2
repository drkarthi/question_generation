Starting from the outside boundary of the software,  we work towards the  inside  and try toidentify the inputs and the processing which is necessary to meet the functions of the systems.We said that the requirement analysis phase consist of meeting users,  finding out  detailedrequirements  as to see them and in fact it may be also study the existing systems by followingvarious activities which happen in the real world.<p>

And since these activities is a fairly long drawn activity, many people are involved lot of recordkeeping has to be done.<s> Its important that we use appropriate tools and also build different typesof models through which our understanding can be concisely stated and can be verified with theusers.<s> So these are the different phases we have discussed last time.<s> Let us continue further andsee what is available further in requirement analysis phase  and what kind of documentationsstandard are prescribed for recording the finding during analysis phase.<p>

Now structured analysis has often been accepted as one of the common technique to use duringrequirement  analysis.<s> It consist of focusing on various functions and processes existing in  theuser  environment  and then identifying the data  flowing between these functions.<s> We generallyuse the top down decomposition approach in this where initially the whole applications is seen asa single process.<s> For these processes we identify the different inputs, outputs, who are the usersof the systems,  what kind of data  is stored and which need to be used and which  needs to bemade available to the applications.<s> So at the single process view of the applications, the externalinter faces in terms of the inputs, outputs and users are possible data sources are identified.<s> Thisis the initial step or the first step.<s> Hereafter we decompose this process in to sub processes andwe identified the different data  which flow between them.<s> The two techniques which wecommonly used in the structured analysis method are the function decomposition technique andthe data flow diagrams.<p>
