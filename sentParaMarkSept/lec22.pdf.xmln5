Then there maybe market conditions, the  market conditions may drive the fact  that  thesoftware product has to go to market early.It may be at some point in time, if you are aiming for a zero defects kind of software,you may not be there in a year.<s> But market condition maybe dictating that, unless yourelease  the  software in a particular window of opportunity,  then  there is no point  inreleasing the software at all.<s> Because a competitor has probably beaten you to the marketwith  pretty  much exactly the same piece of software with  somebody else is building  orthe need for software like this may not exist outside that window.<p>

So it  is either driven by competition or it is driven by the need for such a piece ofsoftware.<s> It may become obsoleted  because the fact that some other environmentalconditions change and the software is no longer needed in the first place.So getting to market early may be a concern and this is also something that is going toend up driving the confidence building process too: What is the level of confidence youneed to have and what is the amount of risk that the organization is willing to undertakein order to release the software product into the market?<p>

There can be two kinds of at the highest level [dec..not clear]  of verification methods.The static and dynamic verification is that what we call them.<p>
