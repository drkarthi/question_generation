So the product oriented processes specify and create the products  for the project.<s> Theyvary  definitely from one project to another.<s> These  both process groups  overlap andinteract  during the life of the project.<s> So,  for instance,  it  is not possible to define thescope of a  project  without  knowing  the details of the product and  similarly many othersituations  will prove that the product management processes and the product orientedprocesses  must integrate and coexist within the project.<s> So  this brings us to the nextimportant particular part what is called as life cycle.<p>

So now we have project life cycle and we have product life cycle.<s> So what is the projectlife cycle?The project life cycle model basically tells you how the project will run and the productlife cycle tells you how the product will be used effectively.<s> Now please remember, forinstance, a project may come to an end when the product is produced but the life cycle ofthe product does not seize there but the life cycle of the product continues for a very longtime till the products actually retires.<p>

So, for instance, a project to bring a new model of PC into the market maybe one of theprojects  but the product life cycle for the PC is going to be a very different kind of amodel.<s> So,  many times the large products are often built as a series of activity.<s> So,  inshort we can say that project management is a cross life cycle activity;  it is performedacross all phases  and the concepts of life cycle module are  central to all projectmanagement thinking.<s> Basically  achieving control  is not possible unless we are able toplan it and planning cannot be done unless we have  well-defined life cycle.<s> So,  bettercontrol is achieved only through defining this life cycle.<s> So, having a life cycle helps youin clarifying the objectives, planning, then performing, execution of the particular projectand getting a feedback and reviewing the feedback to make sure that the project is stillworthwhile.<p>
