Now we say,  irrespective of the parent distribution the distribution of sampling  in  willalways tend to be in normal and using this kind of a formula if you are able to take theproject and break it down into components then the number of components is reasonablylarge then as the number of components increases the estimate that you get will tend to bemore and more closer to the mean but also the mean of that particular estimation willfollow normal distribution and you are able to do many of the other calculations with thisthing.<p>

The PERT sizing approach, the advantages,  you need to go to a low level break up andthat is why your estimates are likely to be accurate.<s> The disadvantages that you need a lotof information for doing it that means you cannot do this particular kind of an approachunless you go fairly deep into the project.<s> This technique is not usable in the early stagesof the project.<s> So once you have got these estimates for individual components then youcan add up  these  particular estimates and make a total estimate for the entire project.Similarly,  if you want you can find out a standard deviation and variance for the entireproject, the formula for that being b minus a by 6 or whatever, the most pessimistic minusthe optimistic divided by six is the reasonable estimate of the standard deviation and ofcourse  you know the principle that the variances are additive in nature and you can findout the total variations.<p>

Incase you want to do probabilistic estimates then this technique will also tell you withhow much confidence you can say that the project time or project cost or project qualitywhatever the parameter you are estimating with what confidence that particular parameteris  achievable.<s> This  is  a  very useful technique.<s> Now,  beyond the PERT sizing kind ofapproach we have algorithmic modules.<s> Usually  people are enamored by this  particularthing  and they think that this is the  end of the estimation  which  is not.<s> But algorithmmodels do play a very important role in making the estimate.<p>
