Meaningful variations can be distinguished from the random variation.<s> Any time you do ameasurement  you are only approximating the reality and some of it is going to be theerror due to the wrong assumptions and the wrong understanding of the subject, the otheris going to be the random variation in the measurement process.<s> So  we should be in aposition to identify the quote and quote,  the explained variance and the unexplainedvariation in this particular kind of job.<p>

Once you start coming to level 4 then the projects that you produce will definitely be ofvery high quality and obviously the projects will be very controlled.<s> So  it  is definitelyshowing that you are making a progress whereby  you  are  managing the projects in aquantitative kind of a manner.<s> You must first realize that we go to optimizing level it isnot a destination that we reach and then stay there that nobody can dislodge you there.<s> Atlevel 5 when we talk of optimization we are talking of sort of remaining  at level 5 thenreaching level 5.<p>

Here when we see the slide, what we are doing is to improve basically create.<s> The lessonslearnt in the past that we were talking about is we were only using what we had but nowwe need to continuously add to our standard procedure  so the knowledge base that wehave has to keep on widening and in level 5 what we are basically doing is providing anenvironment in which the pool of knowledge that you  have goes on increasing,organization focus is on improvement and now you get both incremental and innovativeimprovements.<p>

Now,  the incremental advances must happen on an  ongoing basis  like  some smallimprovements and periodically you may have innovative improvements.<s> Suppose there isa breakthrough technology that is available or you  evolve a new method or somethinglike that so your improvement optimizing basically means improvement  would becoming both in small dosage  on  an ongoing  basis  and periodic  burst of very innovativekind of an  improvement that you will have.<s> Therefore  what we are aiming at is aproactive identification of process.<p>
