We have  already seen that we  need to separate the concerns through the modulardecomposition and we have also seen that there are different ways for decomposition.<s> Forexample,  the  hierarchical structures you can build.<s> The decomposition gives you ahierarchical structure.<s> You can decompose a system into a part whole hierarchy.<s> There isa big system and then there are parts inside the system.<s> A  part whole hierarchy forexample there is a computer and in the computer there are different parts such as cards,monitors, keyboard and or different IC chips and so on.<s> You give design in a part wholeand then further it can be decomposed as what are the parts of the card and what are theparts in the chip and so on.<p>

Or  you can take a classification hierarchy or inheritance hierarchy or a IS-A  hierarchy.Another way of decomposing is instance of hierarchy, it uses types.<s> For example, a is atype of b and b is a type of c and so on In  languages like Smalltalk, you have objects,classes  and there are Meta classes.<s> This  is another way of decomposing a system.Another orthogonal perspective is that of focus of attention which is zooming.<s> You havehigh level design and then you go on to a lower level and zoom on to that and then youfurther zoom on to that to get this structured decomposition.<s> These are different ways ofstructuring your design.<s> In UML state chart,  you can zoom on to a state and give aseparate state chart for the stage.<s> This is the way to decompose your system so that youwill be able to understand request at the high level at the top level and then further go ondownwards and zoom on to your sub systems or your sub design.<p>
