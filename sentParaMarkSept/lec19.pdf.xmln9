So,  basis set has three parts.<s> You take the first  condition and then take one branch andcover it.<s> Then, go to another branch, take the condition, take the branch and cover it andthen for the second one cover the other branch as well and keep the earlier one as it is tillthe condition.<s> So, you get the top path, the middle path and the lower path.<s> This is yourbasis set and these three parts if you cover you are able to cover all the statements.<s> This isyour example for cyclomatic complexity.<p>

And it will be interesting to see that even if you have  too many statements and manypaths, this number of region that you have could be small.<s> This basis  set gives you theupper bound and these many paths you need to generate.<s> So, how do you generate thesepaths?<s> You have to select the value such that these paths get covered.<s> So you have toselect appropriate values of a and b.<s> The next slide tells you what these values are.<s> So, ifwe look at this example again.<s> Three independent paths are as follows:  One is, a  isfound to be true.<s> And then a is not found to be true, but b is found to be true.<s> And ais not found to be true and b is also not found to be true.<s> (Refer Slide Time: 38:14)<p>

So, test suite is the following: a is true; b is false.<s> We have chosen b to be false herewith a is true, but it doesnt matter.<s> Then a is  false; b true is another test.<s> And testnumber 3 is, a is false and b is false.<s> So these three tests can cover all the statements.These three tests give you the three basic paths in this particular example.<s> If you have thisstatement which you can find in the bottom of the slide: If (a or b) then x else y, thenyou  require three test cases such that you can cover all the paths in this control flowgraph and all the basic paths that is independent paths in the basis set and then that resultsin covering all the statement in the program.<p>
