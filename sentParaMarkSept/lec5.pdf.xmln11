So we can start breaking it up.<s> Let us say in grid editor example, one requirement can beabout the grid facilities where the grid itself should be laid out as a matrix of horizontaland vertical lines, and it should always be a background to the editor window.<p>

(Refer Slide Time: 41:26)<p>

That is a very specific requirement and the grid shall be a passive grid where thealignment of the entities is the users responsibility.<s> That is one particular requirement.There can be some rationale to back up this requirement as shown in the slide.<s> And thespecification is very clear, it says this particular tool shall be used to build and this isthe person who wrote out this specific requirement 2.6.1 about grid facilities.<p>

So it is about a  structured  representation of the same requirement,  instead of simplywriting it down in plain English paragraph, and breaking it up to certain set of sections.The first section could be stating the actual requirement,  the second section is rationalefor  Why  and this provides the intent of the goal of the user which can be taken intoaccount  by the designer of the system down the road.<s> And then if there are any otherconstraints that are to be met as far as this requirement is concerned.<s> There can bespecific technologies that can be used to meet the requirement  and there can be certainprocesses  to design this requirement and so on.<s> The source of the requirement mustalways be included.<s> The reason behind is that if there is any ambiguity about it, then thesource can be contacted and the appropriate clarifications can be sorted out.<p>
