Suppose we have a project action based on all the information that comes like actioningmeans something that requires your particular action.<s> At  the lowest level we have theproject level internal meetings that may be happening.<s> So internal project meetings willalso provide project level information, consolidation and this particular data is given.<s> Atthe next level we may have customer level kind of a thing, the status reporting that youhave,  the customer reviews of the status report will also provide inputs for actioning.Then  you have the steering committee that really is the project managers boss and youare sending them steering status reports and  this particular steering meetings may alsolead to lot of inputs for taking action.<s> And last but not the least a lot of issues may cropup for reasons best note to Almighty.<p>

(Refer Slide Time: 31:36)<p>

From  that particular point of view we need to have several issue resolutions meeting.Issue resolutions meeting are the only things which are  not planned in the project plan;they take place as and when required.<s> But basically what you are saying is, like wheneveryou have this kind of a structure and communication this communication leads to a lot ofinformation being sent within the project and within the stake holders and of course fromwithin the project to outside the project and receiving the data from outside the project toinside the project.<p>

The administrative closure in a theoretical sense occurred at the end of the project but aswe have seen earlier it overlaps with some part of the project and it continues well aftertechnically the project is complete.<p>

If you look at the slide the administrative closure process involves collecting the projectrecords,  ensuring  that they reflect the final product that we have  delivered  and  hopingthat it is according to the specification then it involves analyzing the projects success andeffectiveness and making sure that the lessons learnt are appropriately digested in theproject processes,  matrices and the checklist and last but not the least archiving theinformation for future use.<s> So, updating the employee skills, database and reflecting newskills that have been learnt by the people while doing this particular project are the kindof activities that has come here.<s> The administrative closure process output basically givesyou outputs like formal acceptance,  project archives,  project closures and the lessonslearnt.<p>
