Therefore,  adequate amount of reviews and testing will have to be performed at  thecorresponding reports generated.<s> Once that change will be made probably the next thingis to accept the change in to the store and make changes to the Metadata.<s> This particularthing may look trivial but it is not, it is like how many times we had a packing list whichwas different from the contents of the box and the answer is very simple,  by the sametoken the developer may tell you that he is submitting version 1.8  of a particularcomponent  and what accompanies in the accompanying file is a version 1.7  or suchparticular problems can happen.<s> So  once we have the change check in then thecorresponding version number is also changed in that particular thing.<p>

Once  you have done that we close the change request and we write so in the log sayingthat the change request has been implemented.<s> And  last but not  the least once that hasbeen done we intimate all concerned that the change xyz has actually been made.<s> And animportant entry in the change control procedures and configuration managementprocedures is the concept of Change Control Board which is often called as CCB.<s> ChangeControl Board is the formal group which is responsible for approving and of courseotherwise rejecting the change request.<p>

Please understand all the change requests  are  not of same particular priority and  theanalogy like the car not starting is a category A problem which means immediate fixingand that the car not having a headlight or the horn or they are getting stuck in a particulargear that means it works but not to full performance level would be the second particularlevel and the third would be having a scratch on the paint.<s> You will say yes, whenever thecar goes for repair around such kind of changes can be taken care of that point of time.<s> Sothe CCBs decision to accept or reject a change is not merely dependent on your giving arequest and the genuineness of the request because the CCB has to take into accountseveral considerations.<p>

The  primary function of the CCB is to  provide guidelines for preparing the changerequest, how to make it then providing the  guidelines  for evaluating the change  requestand last but not the  least managing the implementation of approved changes.<s> So  CCBmay have procedures for retrospective handling changes also.<p>

Take  a simple example;  if there is an emergency kind of a change  somebody  may beauthorized to make that particular change on the spot and take the approval from the CCBretrospectively.<s> Even  this kind of thing can happen in a live production environment ifsomething goes down and need immediate fixing then such an extreme action may haveto be taken.<s> There may also be a concept of automatic approval for predefined categoriesof changes.<p>
