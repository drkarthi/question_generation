Then  the other one is the iterative enhancement model.<s> you make very  very smallchanges, you  see the effect of these changes by running through all the tests  and thendetermine if there are no side effects then you incorporate the change and then you go tothe next small change and so on and so forth.<s> The full reuse model basically is trying tosay that you  start  as if you  were starting with  requirements  for  a  new system and youreuse as much as possible from the old system that exist so it  is almost as if  everyiteration  o the software were  a  brand new system that you are building  except that youhave reused everything from the old system.<s> But this is typically not very practical to do.If you have to make a quick fix and you have to turn around to fix in the matter of twentyfour hours which is often the case something that cannot be done as a  full reuse modelobviously.<p>

So let us take a look at the process of change itself.<s> I am just going to kind of write outthe process here and we will follow it as we go long.<s> (Refer Slide Time: 41:42)<p>

The change process typically starts with what is called a change request.<s> This is the firststep in the  change  process.<s> The  user is the one that submits  the change request;  it canactually come from the developer of the system as well who feels that something needs tochange.<s> The  change request can be of many types:  it  can be a user directed  changerequest, it can be a change request driven by the engineers of the system itself and so on.The moment the change request comes in the next step is to do an analysis of the impactthat the change is going to have.<p>

So you might want to go back and say is this going to cause  a  structural change to thesoftware; is this nearly going to cause a change in few lines of code; do the new test caseshave to be written for this, do the existing test covers the change that I am making and soon and so forth.<s> So that is the impact analysis so that will come back with, for example, acategory of change that would have to occur: major, minor, medium level change etc etc;it could also give back an effort level analysis of how much time would be required; whatis the modules that would change so that is the impact analysis output.<s> After this it has tobe scheduled so you would have to schedule this for a particular release of the softwareso next step is what is called release planning.<p>
