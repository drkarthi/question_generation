Take  a simple example; suppose  we have a screen and in  this particular screen thetemplate of the format has some spelling mistake say name has been spelled as instead ofn a m e you are spelled it n m a e and obviously such thing needs a change.<s> But makingthis change is not going to have any impact on the cost or schedule or any other customerrelationship related kind of problems or impact on the quality then we say that theapproval of such a request can be easily done at a lower level than the CCB.<s> Thesechanges need to be documented but at the same time they need not go all the way up toCCB and the designators  authority may  be allowed or authorized to make someparticular change.<p>

This brings us to another question; is CCB a board or is it a single entity?The answer is again, it  depends,  in case there is a small project then CCB is a singleperson entity and if it is a very large project then CCB will be group of people or it mayhave a hierarchy under it.<s> If it is a multi-site project you may have two power centers likewe say in politics two power centers and CCB may be split at two locations.<p>

So  please remember,  CCB  is the authority which decides whether to or not to make achange,  when to make a change and at  what appropriate point of time these  particularchanges need to be released.<s> Therefore, once we have done these particular changes thenext particular thing is change control commentation.<s> How  do  we make sure that allconcern people have been intimated that the change has happened?The  responsibility of making sure that the change is communicated to everybodybasically rests with the project manager.<s> The project manger is responsible for integratingall changes and making sure that all concerned know about it.<s> It is important to make surethat all concerned person are in sink about the latest projects information.<s> No two peopleshould think that they are working with respect to two different components or twodifferent versions of the same components and so on and so forth.<p>
