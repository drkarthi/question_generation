Since you are also doing manual inspections of the code base of designs, discussing thedesign document before  you move on,  there is some degree of optimality that can beachieved by focusing your attention on specific pieces of the system.Say, if there is a  very critical part of the system,  maybe only you want to do a  formalspecification and go down that route.<s> Or  may be there is a piece of the system that isbeing thoroughly inspected and you have a high degree of confidence in that part of thesystem may be the testing does not have to be that exhaustive in that particular module ofthe system and so on.<p>

So,  the planning is something that has to be done  and  it should start very early in thedevelopment process.<s> In fact the V&amp;V development process,  the verification/validationdevelopment process emphasizes  that you start writing test cases as soon as therequirements are written, as soon as the specifications are written.So, the testing process does happen in parallel with the development process.<s> We shouldtake a look at the process itself in a little while.<p>

And certainly there should be a balance between the static verification methods and thetesting methods or the dynamic verification methods, just like we talked about little whileago.And finally test planning is all about defining standards for  the testing process.<s> Forexample what is the test environment going to be like, what degree of scalability testingare you going to end up doing?Say, if this system is going to take hundred thousand users at any given point in time andyou are not going to be able to test  it  for hundred thousand users.<s> So you have to havesome means of building a confidence that when tested for hundred users,  you can somehow extrapolate those results to ensure that the system is going to work with same levelof performance with hundred thousand users.<p>

Is this system going to scale?<s> -  is the question that is going be  asked.<s> And so in testplanning you try to build confidence that the test that you are doing are indeed going tolet you know that the system is going to scale or not.<p>
