Now, look at what are the types of software development activities that we perform canbe grouped  at.<s> So these grouping the way  you..  it is like a mechano  set  you have thesame basic pieces but putting them together you can make different models you can makea truck or tractor or aero plane from the same pieces.<s> By same particular logic using thesimilar basic minimal activities of software development it is possible to evolve severaldevelopment strategies for a particular project.<p>

The first one for instance is a  one shot.<s> This  is  an  ideal kind of a strategy.<s> It  kind ofassumes that you have a well-known application and you need to start and finish it in one.If  you  need  develop a payroll or inventory application it might possibly fall in thisparticular kind of activity.<s> Very rarely large projects are ever undertaken with this type ofan approach.<p>

The next particular approach is the phased approach.<s> here what happens is the project istoo large  we can conceive it together but  we may not be wanting to commit all theresources at the same time  in which particular case what you  can do is conceive theproject as a whole but execute one phase at a time; execute one phase at a time; the nextparticular approach can be multi shot.<s> The multi shot approach is developed  that aredifferent from the phased  activity in the sense that you look at only a very narrowsegment one at a time and then go to the next segment at a time not looking beyond theframe of reference that you got in mind.<s> But there are other types of strategies also.<p>

Prototyping is very important strategy.<s> Prototyping  in  a different context can  bementioned as a sampling activity.<s> Now let us take a simple example.<s> I am interested intesting 5000 programs and somebody recommends use of a new tool and I am may not bewanting to commit all my  activity using this particular tool because of  no priorexperience of using this tool;  in such case I can always say that  let  us take a smallexercise; let us take 50, 100 programs out of the 5000 if you got, try to test them with thisparticular tool, at the end of it review our experience in testing these particular programsand if our  experience is happy we can proceed and  apply the same thing to the entireproject;  we can apply the same  thing to the  entire project  so this kind of approach isknown as a prototyping approach.<p>
