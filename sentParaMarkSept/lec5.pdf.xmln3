Files that are created by tools other than what the system provides has been translateddown to something much more precise in this particular case and that is what really triesto bring out the difference between a users requirement definition which gets translateddown into more precise specification.<s> It is  not a definition,  but is a specification ofexactly the kind of functionality that the system was  expected to provide.<s> And also theexceptional conditions that might be encountered and how the system is going to end upreacting to these kind of exceptional situations.<s> So as we see,  there are three differentcategories of documents that can end up getting  created at the very  start of softwaredevelopment process.<p>

One is a set of user requirements and the audience for the user requirements that I havementioned before,  are typically the end user; system end users themselves, the mostimportant audience.<s> And certainly the managers of the customers are going to end upbuying the systems,  because they may not understand engineering jargon  that goesbehind the building the system.<s> What they are interested is the end product of the process,eventually and what they are going to get.<s> At the same time the engineers would beinterested, the developers who end up building a system would also be interested lookingat this just to get an idea of what the users ends up expecting.<p>

The system requirements however have a different kind of audience.<s> The systemrequirements are not by the user,  not for the user,  but translating the user requirementsinto more precise specification,  that translation is  done often by system architects or bybusiness analysts within the software development company.<s> And the audiences typicallyare meant to be the development staff themselves.<s> And it is some what closer to a designspecification although design specifications now get into the area  of defining how tobuild the system and not what the system is expected to do.<p>
