Thus,  you have system level objectives,  you have functional objectives and you have atthe last quality objective to be achieved by the project.<s> Similarly,  critical  projectattributes for a particular project can also be specified.<s> So  we will say what are thecritical attributes.<s> You say critical attributes are those attributes which if not achieved theproduct will be deemed  to be a failure;  the product will be deemed  to be a failure;  theproject will be of no use.<p>

Now take a simple example.<s> Suppose  you are having a CSI convention in Bombay andyou are required to develop a CSI conference registration system  and  your  system isgoing to be ready two weeks after the CSI convention is over; here having a problem onhand.<s> But we know from our experience that lots of projects get delayed well beyond twoweeks and fine nothing  seems to happen;  a payroll project for instance gets  delayed bytwo weeks, nobody is  going to really bring the heaven and earth  together.<s> So you  saycritical attributes are those which the project must achieve and the other attributesdifferent degree of levels need to be achieved.<p>

Usually  there are product attributes  which are critical and there are project attributeswhich are critical.<s> Now, reliability and speed may be like the product attributes whereasthe quality,  cost and schedule maybe grouped as the project attributes  which areimportant.<s> Now let us take an illustration.<p>

(Refer Slide Time 29:20)<p>

Look at the slide.<s> One of the hospitals wanted to develop a hospital information system.So what objectives did they have in mind?<s> So the first and foremost, the objective was tomake available, wherever required, integrated real time information about the patient, ofcourse to all concerned.<s> The second particular objective was  to help in optimizing thesharing of hospitals resources across various departments.<s> This particular aspect is veryimportant,  please note.<s> Many  times the information is generated and kept in onedepartment and it is not very easily available to other departments.<p>
