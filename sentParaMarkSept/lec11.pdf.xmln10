The first of them is predicting the demand, then there is sub process called forecast stock levels,then the third sub process is check the inventory and the next process is to determine whatquantities to order.<s> Hence  reordering,  checking inventory,  forecasting stock levels,  predictingdemand these four sub activities make the overall activity of control inventory,  What we do inthe process decomposition or function decomposition is to look at a process, study what happensin that, and then identify the sub processes which taken together indicate what really happens inthis process.<s> It gives a better understanding of what is required.<s> For example, in controlinventory we need to carry out these subtasks.<s> This is what the function diagram represents.<p>

Here is a small exercise.<s> You can prepare such functional decomposition diagrams for somecommon situations which are quite well familiar to you.<s> Function decomposition diagram for arailway reservation system, for a hospital patient management system, and for the payroll systemof employees.<s> In each of these cases, try to create the scenarios for these applications and preparethe function decomposition diagrams for them.<p>

Here are some general guidelines of preparing the function decomposition model.Use proper naming of processes.<s> This is very important, because through proper namingyou are conveying the purpose of a process.Business functions are generally named as nouns.<s> These could be marketing inventorycontrol and so on.<s> These are typical business functions and we use nouns for representing them.And it should be either a single word or a simple phrase such as marketing or inventory control.Processes are named consisting of active verb followed by an object, because processrepresent some action therefore we have a verb representing that action and action is havingsome purpose.<s> It has a target; we represent that as an object.<s> Some of the good examples areaccept order, calculate interest for process names.<p>
