What is the initiating process?Initiating  process is all those activities which help in bringing a project formally intoexistence.<s> It is like getting a birth certificate for a baby that is born.<s> So all the activitiesthat needs to be performed in terms of validating the proposal and getting the approvalsand appointing a project manager and calling the meetings of the concerned  people,allocating the resource kind of things etc; all these activities will have to be done duringinitiating process and actually end up with a big kick off to say that the project has reallystarted the project has really started.<p>

Now, once the project has physically come into existence the next most important projectprocess is the planning process.<s> And if you have to say which is the most crucial processgroup in any particular project it is this the planning process to decide what work to do,when to do, how to do, who will do it, how to commit the resources so it is all these kindsof activities.<s> You must realize one thing; planning activity does not start and stop at thebeginning of the project and some of it may continue throughout the early phases.<p>

For instance, when you start developing a project, at the beginning of the project we maynot even know what kind of programs are going to be developed,  which programs andhow many and so on so the question of planning to allocate the programming work doesnot arise and the planning usually opens as a rolling window kind of approach; the moreinformation becomes available  the more is the need for planning the immediate nextparticular design.<p>
