So module is a building block and the different modules are interrelated in terms of execution.<s> Amodule may invoke another module and pass certain data  to this module and expect certaincomputations.<s> For example,  a  module may solve the data  in  an  ascending order or it maycompute the tax for a given employee.<s> Now this module expects certain data to be given as inputand it produces results.<s> Such a  module will be called from another module.<s> So we are nowtalking  about the execution architecture of given software which is defined in terms of themodules and the calls that they make on each other.<s> Now these modules are important elementsas we just now said that these are the building blocks.<s> Good software architecture should makethese modules as independent as possible.<s> An independent module is one which has  a  clearresponsibility, which has a well defined task to do.<s> It does its function, which is a cohesive kindof a function.<p>
