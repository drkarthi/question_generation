The  analyst real objective at this point is to find the really efficient and cost effectivesolution to the kind of problems that the librarian has noticed.<s> And one of the solutioncould be to identify clearly the benefits and cost.<s> So these benefits and cost must beidentified  for the kind of solution that we might propose.<s> So  analyst should focused onthe problem and coming up with a  solution which is addressing those problems.<s> Theproblem is primarily that of efficiency and cost effectiveness.<s> So the first thing that theanalyst should do at this time is that after getting a statement of problems from thelibrarian and doing some background checking on what kind of organization it is andwhat kind of activities are included in the circulation function, the next thing that analystshould do is to define the project scope.<p>

Now since this is the organization which is quite readily understood why most of us thatit is a library whose main purpose is to issue books to the users.<s> So we know what kind oforganization it is.<s> Now we have also seen the kind of problems the librarian hasmentioned now we are at this point trying to given idea of the scope of the project to thelibrarian.<s> How much made cost to the library to solve such a problem and wherecomputerization could be a solution.<s> So at this point library indicates that it can spendabout  5 lakhs rupees and we can thing of in house development where we will save onthe cost of development that we need to pay to  external agency.<s> If  you have in houseprogrammers then they are already on job and we will not have a separate salarycomponent in the cost.<s> But in this case lets  assume that  the development  agency is theseparate one and the user in this case indicates that his budget is up to 5 lakhs rupees.So is this a reasonable cost?<s> Can the project really be done in the amount or somethingclose to this amount which has been indicated by the librarian.<p>
