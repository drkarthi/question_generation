For  example,  if you need a  40 Gig hard drive or a 80 Gig  hard drive you pick  theappropriate component  and you assemble everything  together so you  unify all of theseand you may have to do some gluing work.<s> In  this case you might have to make yourown motherboard which allows all these  components to interact with each  otherappropriately using the standards that have been specified.<s> But  if you take a look atsoftware engineering traditionally it is been more focused on building all the core all theway from scratch every time unless it is in the same company.<p>

For  example, if I were going to build  a graphical user interface for an e-commercewebsite there have  been hundreds of e-commerce  websites that has been  built; a  lot ofthese user interface  notions are already available as prebuilt components.<s> But typicallythe tendency is to build  the entire e-commerce website from scratch;  you take a HTMLeditor  and sit down and start building the e-commerce  website and over the last five toten years how the realization has definitely come in that this is an expensive process thefirst thing and it is prone  to errors;  every time you end up writing new  codes  you arelikely to introduce errors  so the way of reducing the error rate or  increasing therobustness of the software that you are going to produce at the end of a project would beto try and reuse proven code try and  reuse proven components  that have been writtenearlier that have been tested thoroughly  and have been used in previous productionsituations.<s> So, if you are just able to pick that off and reuse as it is then you not only savetime but you also provide error free code.<p>
