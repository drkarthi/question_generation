So now let us now look at what is the need for formal project management.<s> The first needarrives at basically because the sponsors of the project are interested in making sure thatthe resources allocated are properly utilized.<s> They are also interested in completion of theproject  on  time,  then the project work itself involves identifying the requirement whichitself is a very difficult task; all the stakeholders may have conflicting expectations fromthe project and the resources that you need for the project need to compete with the otheractivities of the organization because organization ultimately has a  very limited pool ofresources and it is from this pool of resources that your project needs  to acquire theresources and your project does not run in a vacuum it is faced by problems like scarcityof resources, uncertainties, conflicting interest of stakeholders etc.<s> So, it is not possible toget a project done without having a formal project management.<p>

Then we come to the next particular topic who executes the project.<s> So, even though theprojects are temporary and unique in nature it cannot run in isolation;  they need to runwithin the framework of the organization.<s> So the project may be undertaken either withinthe organization itself or  it may be undertaken by sponsoring it to an outside  agencywhich specializes in undertaking such projects.<s> (Refer Slide Time 08:18 min)<p>

So,  if  you look at it that from particular  a  point of view the first figure shows that youhave a project which is being done within the walls of the organization.<s> Alternatively youmay have a situation where the project is completed by a sponsoring agency outside theorganization.<s> Now,  once we got this particular thing we say  okay  whoever is executingthe project the project basically runs within the organization then we look at the projectsfit within the organization.<s> So there are socio-economic environments in an organization;we have a structural framework about for instance the organizations structure, we havepolitical framework of the organization, we have power balances within the organizationand there are competing applications within the organization then symbolic frameworkslike like who needs to do what and who needs to be sort of giving his or her blessings forcompleting that particular project in an organization is very necessary.<p>
