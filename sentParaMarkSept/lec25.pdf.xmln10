The testing cycles that you go through may be entirely different is one good example ofhow these two things are treated differently.<s> And the changes in the case of maintenanceare typically affected by modifying the existing code and components rather than addingnew components or adding a lot of new code.<s> So the example that I gave of adding thebusiness process rules engine in order to make it easier to setup and change business rulesin software is a major change; you are adding a new component which is a rules engine inthis case and that does not come into the heading of maintenance.<p>

So we will explore the process of maintenance a little more today.<s> Maintenance is boundto happen for various reasons.<s> One of the reasons is that software is the process of testingsoftware is never perfect; it is almost impossible to test the entire gamut of input rangesthat can be applied to a particular piece of software.<s> So, for example, if there are twentyparameters and every parameter can range among hundreds and thousands of  values  itcan end up taking it cannot be possible to test the software, every possible combination ofinput that it can come under.<p>

So testing is never perfect in software.<s> Every single path in the software to exercise thatwould probably take years for any kind of medium to major system.<s> So testing is doneselectively as a result of which there could be bugs or errors that are left over when youcompare to the original specification of the software because this can never becompletely automated and it is done by humans and also there is a conscious engineeringreason for limiting testing in particular areas.<s> This could result in certain left over errorsthat would have to be fixed once the software  is  put into  put into service.<s> And this is arisk issue;  you  (go.22:00)  the  amount of risk  that  exist by doing a certain amount oftesting to a particular module of the software and if the risk is something that you can livewith you can go ahead with that limited testing.<p>
