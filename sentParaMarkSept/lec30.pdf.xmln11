Next important thing is put all requirements in writing;  keep those things current andhave them readily accessible, do not put the requirements documents under safety so thatnobody can look at it and say  it  is a very important document  signed  by the client andfrom that point of view it  cannot be touched  by  the ordinary and the mundane peopleworking on the project.<p>

Extensively use case tools  for getting the  requirements and subsequently  generating thedepth what you call implementing the project based on this particular requirement.<s> Not avery successful approach but one approach also is to make the users sign off  thingswhenever the  documents are produced.<s> Please  remember,  this particular suggestion hasonly a limited application because if the user is totally unaware of your way of writing,describing and specifying things he may just either not sign or sign the document withoutreally understanding.<p>

Also, you make sure that the deliverables to the project are delivered on a regular basis;that you have periodic meeting with the users,  then do the testing throughout the lifecycle,  make the project information available to all concerns,  develop and follow arequirement management process,  evaluate the change request,  have some kind of achange control board which will look at impact analysis of each particular change beforeit is made.<s> So these suggestions will help you in minimizing the changes and obviously ifthe changes are minimized then the scope change control process will work very well.<p>

What are the typical outputs from a scope change control process?First  is,  scope changes.<s> These are the agreed please underline the word  agreeddocumentation it is called agreed modifications to the scope which are documented andwhich are feedback into the planning process and they are intimated to  all thestakeholders.<s> So  whenever you  make a change make sure that it is documented,  it isapproved, authorized, then you make changes to the plan and intimate all concerned thatthe change has been made.<s> So the results will be very obvious in that.<p>
