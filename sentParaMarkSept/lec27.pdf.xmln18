For example,  suppose you are looking for a lisp  component,  your  system specificationsays you need a lisp or singly linked lisp in this case what you really find is only a doublylinked lisp is available as a reusable component so you basically modify the specificationof the system at this point to say I am going to use a doubly linked lisp because it reallyprovides all the functionalities that could be required and in this case is an example of thecomponents requirements are a superset of what is really needed within the design thatyou have created.<p>

There can be a situations where it is a subset and  the  component may now have to beextended a little bit as well and then you do the architectural design at that point in timeusing the set of components that have been discovered and now you search for otherreusable components and so on and then you specify all the system components based onthe reusable component.<s> So this is the development with reuse scenario at this point intime and the last half of this process is not the search for reusable components hereis different than the search for reusable components here (Refer Slide Time: 40:03) why;basically because the  first part  is referring to design with reuse and the second part isreferring to design for reuse.<s> So, one of the components that you may be building mightlook very very similar to a generic component that can be created out of this.<s> So, whatyou should do is to then extend the effort to make this piece slightly generate if theproject can absorb the cost because there is certain cost to be paid when you try to makesomething more generate and then you specify the system components that are based onreusable components at that point in time.<p>
