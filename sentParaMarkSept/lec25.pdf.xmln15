Coming back to the cause issue that we were just been discussing let us take a look at anexample of  two systems that we have  studied empirically and I  have kind of drawn agraph here that shows what the relative cause of development in maintenance  were  forthese two systems; what is graph is showing is in hundreds of thousands of dollars on thex axis what are the cause and here it is just showing two different systems over a periodof time;  system one basically took about 150,000  dollars  to  be  developed these are theexamples of real systems that we have looked at and over a period of the next three yearsit took about additional 250,000 dollars to maintain so the investing in the building of thesystem  would it turned out  as  it  turned out was  not such a big deal as investing in  themaintenance of the system.<p>

Another example that we also studied is the second system here is the large ERP systemwhich we took above 175,000 dollars to build and then you know the maintenance costwere anywhere  between  350  to  400,000 dollars over  the next three years which is wellover two and half times the original cost of building the software.<p>

So you see why it is important to pay attention to the to the notion of maintenance as a lotof attention has been paid  to development;  development methodologies  exist,development tools exists, ids existed and so on and so forth, cm systems exist but not asmuch importance traditionally was given to maintenance until these problems wererealized through extensive empirical studies and that is why we study this as part of themainstream course on software engineering today.<p>
