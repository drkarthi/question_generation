What kind of assumptions we need to make?Let  us  make  an assumption that the amount of time required for doing integration isdirectly proportional to the number of units or programs  being integrated in steps.<s> Thatmeans if you are integrating two programs the effort required  will be two  units  and  incase you are integrating four programs at the same time the  effort required will be fourunits of time.<p>

Now, making this particular assumption that each stage of our testing we can put on howmany programs are  really  going into each of these  particular  stages.<s> So in our case weidentify that for the system and acceptance testing we are putting three programs togetherand during the update enquiry integration you got two programs  and update and  reportyou have got two programs.<s> Therefore these are all the entire precedence that we have gotwithin these particular activities.<p>

Now looking at this particular data we can now bring up our COCOMO tables and seehow we can get a detailed break up of that.<s> We have now regrouped the data, we put theentire specifications together update query and report together and we have update queryand report for coding and testing together and then the integrations still remains where weare and the precedence is given.<p>

We  have  seen from the earlier COCOMO kind of an  exercise  that the phase effortinvolved in writing these or doing these three parts the specification for update query andthe report program together  is going to be 12 days and the programming effort andcoding effort is going to be for 20 for this particular activity and then for integration allthe integration and testing put together is going to take 8 days.<s> We also know that withinthis particular break up the weightage of these three programs is 30%, 10% and 60% and30%, 10% and 60% here also and we have made the assumption that the total number ofprograms integrated in the  steps that we have will determine the break up of theintegration time.<p>
