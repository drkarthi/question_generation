For example, what does that mean when it comes down to reality is that everything thatcan be made configurable has to be made configurable?<s> A good example of this might bethat the system can work with any database.<s> today we are working with a free databasethat is available and  free software and this may be MySequel for example  or(31:08..sql)  whereas a one steep  system reaches a  certain level of maturity we mighthave to switch over to Oracle, we might have to switch over Sybase and some other kindof relational database that is commercially accepted.<s> So in such a case what we want todo is completely isolate the dependence of the system on the database itself byintroducing some kind of a standard layer such as ODBC, JDBC and so on and then theexact database that you end up using is typically simply a configuration parameter that isplaced in some kind of a configuration file and on changing the configuration parametersthe system picks up the right driver to the database runs with it and is able to function onany database platform.<s> So the system is designed for change; essentially there is not a lotof coupling between different modules of the system; this is something that is a standardsoftware engineering metric that you want to reduce the coupling between modules andyou want to increase the cohesion within a module and that  has been followed in theextreme when it comes down to agile method because of the amount of change that isgoing on all the time within the software.<p>

So the problems with agile methods are it  can be difficult to keep the interest of thecustomers alive because they have to do so much more work in the development of thesoftware here  although  they  are not  exactly sitting  down and coding or  designing theyhave to be constantly involved and to keep that involvement at a high level all the timemay be very very difficult.<s> It may be hard to assemble and maintain a team which getused to the very intense kind of environment that characterizes these methods because thesoftware turnaround time could be small as two to three weeks and for a piece of softwareto get developed  in two to  three weeks implies that there is  going to be some fairlyintense  activities  in those  two  to  three week period so not all people are  capable ofworking at that pace and you have to pick the people who are right  for that kind ofenvironment who thrive on that kind of environment.<p>

Also, prioritizing changes can become very difficult.<s> So which are the requirements thatneed to go out first; the customer typically has the tendency to start saying I want all ofthem because all of them are important to me; and it is very hard for him to prioritize theset of changes that are going to go into the next increment.<s> Also,  there can be multiplestake holders using the system.<s> So, if a system is used by accounting, by finance it is usedby operation, it is used by legal and so on; each person will have a different perspectiveof what is important for them and to put out an increment which serves one group ofstake holders but not another is going to end up alienating the rest of stake holders in theprocess  and  that would become a real  problem.<s> And  as we have already  seen  earliercontracts and the process of writing contracts would be very very hard in this process.<s> So,having  seen the general principles involved in agile software development let us  take alook at a very specific process that has become very very popular for the past five yearsor so; it is called extreme programming.<p>
