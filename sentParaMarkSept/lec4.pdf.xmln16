On the object oriented approach the software consists of different classes.<s> In fact class is themain concept in the object oriented approach, where it has both the data associated with the classand the executable functions associated with the class.<s> So we call these as structure and behaviorfor  a  class.<s> This is a  paradigm which combines the data  and the processing to get them on asingle dimension and identifies classes which have structural properties and which has  abehavior or methods defined for them.<s> It is a  completely different paradigm  and we will seemore details of this subsequently.<p>

Object oriented paradigm is very useful and has occupied very important position in the designof software.<s> And it simplifies greatly, the complex software development.<s> It has not only a newnotion of a class as a unit for organizing the processing as well as the structure, but it provides aconcept of inheritance which allows us to reuse the software from other existing components.We use class diagrams  to show the static structure of the system.<s> The class diagram identifieswhat are these different class components.<p>

And besides the class diagram, we use interaction diagram which indicate the dynamic behaviorof the system in terms of classes interacting with each other.<s> So we will see this object orientedapproach subsequently in much more details.<s> The only point we want to make here is that thereare different ways in which the design can be approached.<s> It could be the conventional approachwhere the architecture consists of functional modules depicted in the form of a structure chart orit could be an object oriented approach.<s> Object oriented approach will decompose also largesystem into various packages.<s> So the principles  are similar that you use the decompositiontechnique into convert the large software into smaller components these components may bemodules or they may be classes and we organize the data and processing among these.<p>

Once we have completed the design  and  also have finalized the approach we can prepare ourdesign document which also has  a  well defined structure.<s> The design document will generallyinclude these different sections which will specify the design completely.<s> We start by giving anoverall introduction when we define the problem for which the design has been prepared.<s> Ifnecessary we indicate here the different such as data flow diagrams, entity relationship diagramsor class diagrams which have been prepared by us and we enclose them as appropriate annexure.Then we define the software structure in terms of the architectural diagrams.<s> We define the datain terms of various database structures, the files or any other important data structures.<p>
