So one can see here that SRS format has taken into account various aspects and we can see thatby using this specification format, we are meeting our expectation that the document will clearlytell the user what features and functions the software will provide and how he will be able to useit.<s> Similarly we have made it detailed enough, so that from here we can hand over this documentto our design team.<s> And they will be able to convert the specifications into a  design.<s> So SRSdocument which is a baseline document needs to be detailed and we must ensure that we havecollected  all these data and put it in the form of a document.<s> Once the SRS is prepared, whichcan be an extensive task for large software, we need to review this with users.<s> There has to be aformal review meeting in which the entire SRS document would be reviewed.<s> There should be asign off, where the users should say that; yes, the SRS document clearly defines what the systemneeds to do.<s> And  also there would be some peer review, which will ensure that the documentcontains enough details for the design activity to be carried out.<s> So we are going to do the designsubsequently.<s> It must contain the enough details, so that the design can be carried out.<p>

We can define the platforms, we can define the capacities,  and we can work out the sizesrequired for the different systems and so on.<s> All these must be possible from the SRS documentand we see that it is detailed enough to give us all these data.<s> It is very important that the analysisphase results in preparation of such a  detailed  and standard document.<s> So we proceed furtheronly when the document is accepted by the users as being complete in all  aspects.<s> Once it issigned off, we proceed to the next phase, which is the design phase.<s> In the design phase ourobjective is to formulate the implementation strategies for the problem that has been identified.So now we move to the how part of the solution.<s> In the SRS phase or in the requirementanalysis phase, we have defined what part of the problem.<s> Now we are trying to address  How the problem should be addressed, how it should be solved?<s> Input to this phase is naturallythe SRS document from the previous step.<s> We now try to consider different technicalalternatives.<p>

We must remember that SRS is a  logical document;  it specifies the requirements, withoutdictating how those requirements must be implemented.<s> Design phase is the first phase in whichwe make  a  transition towards the solution.<s> Different alternatives may be available.<s> These areprimarily technical alternatives, what kind of technology we should use for solving the problem.Now after this point we are going to increase our efforts from phase to phase in order to build thesoftware.<s> It is important to review at this point once again whether the automation boundary thatwe have defined is the appropriate one or not.<s> So we look at not only the different types ofsolutions which may be possible based on the technology options, but we may once againconsider the business functions which needs to be put in the scope of the system.<s> We alsoconsider what type of solutions to create, whether they would be batch or online type of solution,including whether we should make the software or buy something which is readily available inthe market.<s> In fact these are different alternatives in order to realize the goals which have beenstated in the SRS document.<s> So this is a point at which again we consider different alternativesand these alternatives may have different costs and different efforts.<p>
