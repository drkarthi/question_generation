What is the criterion for evaluation basically?Degree  to which the approach is preventive based,  it is systematic, it is integrated withbusiness processes and it is consistently applied across the organization.<s> So in that sensedegree to which the approach embedded  is the effective self evaluation,  feedback,adaptation cycles and continuous improvement is also equally important.<s> Use  of noveltools,  techniques,  methods to do this is also evaluated in the approach.<s> It  indicates  theunique or innovative  approach  that  you may be using  and  obviously in course of timemany of the people may use that particular kind of approach.<s> Then we talk ofdeployment.<p>

You should have identified what are all the things that you should know, how you reallyneed to go about in planning.<s> So it refers to the  extent to which the approach that youhave outlined  is applied to all the relevant areas  in the organization.<s> And activities thatare examined  will be examined  on that particular point of view.<s> So  the  criteria forevaluation could be like  appropriateness and effectiveness of applications  to alltransactions and interactions with the customers and providers of goods and services andthe public at large and other internal interactions associated with different groups whichis  also  important.<s> Internal processes,  activities,  facilities,  employees,  servicecharacteristics all these are looked in deployment.<p>

How have you gone about really ensuring that your approach is put into practice?Once you got the approach right your next particular thing is results.<s> Results refer to theoutcome, the effect in achieving them.<s> Like again we mention, the proof of the puddingis in eating.<s> So,  criteria for evaluation would be like quality levels which aredemonstrated, have  you  been  able to show that  improvement, the  contribution tooutcomes of quality improvement,  then rate of quality improvement,  that significancedemonstrating that the improvement has been derived from the past mistakes, comparisonwith the industry standards and basically you need to keep on showing that you  arecontinuously improving your results, you are sustaining improvement.<s> So if you do thisparticular job in this fashion then you are likely to be meeting these results.<p>
