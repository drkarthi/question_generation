Last  but not the least we  would like to facilitate change in the sense that we should beable  to modify this particular system as  and  when required.<s> So if we add up all theseparticular degrees of influence you get a total of 30.<s> So our adjusted function point countis 30 into .01 plus .65 is equal to .95.<s> Therefore, adjusted function point count is equal to57  that is our unadjusted function point count multiplied by .95  approximately equal to54 function points.<s> So our system is approximately 54 function points.<p>

Once we have got this particular data the next thing that we are interested in is to find outhow much will this particular system cost.<s> Suppose you have decided that this particularsystem will be developed in C++.<s> And  you have got certain norms which tells  you thatincase you are using a COBOL  kind of a language you will  have  about 15  hours  perfunction point, any cryptic language like C, C++, FoxPro or dbase or any such particularthing would take about ten hours of function point and if you are using RDBMS and SQLkind of a thing it will take about six hours per function point count.<s> So from our point ofview we say that our rate is ten hours per function point count and then the developmenteffort would be 54 function point counts into 10 into 8.<s> So ten hours per function point,eight hours per days  gives us the result that the system requirement is 68  mandays  ofeffort.<p>
