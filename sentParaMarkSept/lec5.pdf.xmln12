So the guidelines for writing a set of requirements that can be easily processed, that canbe clearly understood by both parties.<s> Party that is seeking the software system to bebuilt, the party that is actually building the system, should invent some kind of structuredstandard format and to use it across all requirements that you end up writing.<p>

And so along with the structured standard format there may be certain terminology thatmay be defined.<s> All the terminology is going to be defined upfront and the same standardterminology and the language is being used in a very consistent way through the rest ofthe document.<s> The third thing is to use text highlighting.<s> It is a very common feature thatis used to point out important  text  parts of the documents.<s> And it identifies keyrequirements very clearly.<p>

One another thing that we should always take towards is to avoid computer jargon in thespecification of the requirements as far as possible.<s> There can be situation where thiscannot be avoided, for example the usage of frames versus the usage of plain HTML inthe UI.<s> This is to the certain extent does assume knowledge of technology from the usersperspective.<s> And it is a non functional requirement, but to avoid situations which wouldexpect the user to understand certain computer technology in anywhere or at any level isto be avoided as far as possible in requirement specification.<s> The moment therequirement is translated into a specification instead of a definition, these things are goingto stop peeping in and that is  okay at that point in  time.<s> System requirements are moredetailed specifications and their specification as supposed to the requirement definition aswe saw earlier and they are intended to be used as a basis for designing the system downthe road.<p>
