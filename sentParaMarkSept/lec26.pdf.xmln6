So agile methods are typically as we have seen best suited to small business  smallbusiness size systems, small businesses, rapidly changing environments in which it is notvery clear,  so for example you do  not  tend to use agile methods in the development ofsoftware that runsthespace shuttleit is not something that is done that way; there formal methods would need to be used, thespecifications would have to be understood perfectly before you can construct any pieceof software and see it is not likely that you are going to use the software in incrementalmode  on the  space shuttle  but  only when everything is perfect  will the shuttle belaunched.<s> So, in those kinds of systems you do not use agile development.<p>

Systems,  on the other hand,  that very commonly  employ these  kinds  of methods are e-commerce systems in which features can be added on an incremental basis for the basice-commerce site that is got to be up and running for a business to be functional very veryquickly so they need to be able to place an order, they need to be able to validate a creditcard and they need to be able to just take and process the order in the back end.<s> So theplacement of the order, the  validation of the payment method may  be something that isput out there very quickly, put out there first so that the business can get up and runningand processing the order,  for example,  may not be automated for a long time in fact itmay be completely manual behind the scene up until the point where the next incrementdelivers the order processing part of the system and so on.<p>
