So while verification validation is concerned primarily with establishing the existence ofdefects,  debugging is concerned with removing the errors,  locating and repairing theseerrors.Typically you end up forming a hypothesis.<s> The way you go about  debugging is;  thesystem for example, is failing with this set of inputs.<s> Let us say that you gave it a valuegreater than 10  for a particular integer value that it is expecting to take and the systemfails after some point in time.So you form a hypothesis saying,  here is  how the value  is  processed,  here  is what wasdone with the value.<s> You  kind of know the control flow of the program and how theinputs are getting used in the control flow.<s> And based on that you form a hypothesis andthen you test these hypotheses to figure out whether there is system error.So you might sort localizing these.<s> There maybe four modules in the system, you test thefirst module for example,  because you feel that the validation of the input is not beingdone right and it is passing a piece of input that it should not be passing down to the restof the program.<s> If that is the case, you kind of just test that module by testing whether itis doing the validation.<s> That is how the hypotheses do if the validation is not being doneright.So you form a set of such hypothesis and that is how debugging ends up getting done.<p>

Here is the diagrammatic view of the debugging process.<s> You have a set of test results tostart with typically.<s> You have to locate where the error is.<s> The test results also typicallyindicate the software fail, not just that the software fail but where it is failed, typically theline number in the program is something that is indicated as part of the test result.<s> Youtake that and then you take the specification along with that and figure out  where youended up deviating from the specification: What is the specification and why is the testfailing this particular specification?<p>
