The  next particular part is phase break up and the distribution  by phase is given fordifferent tables, there are different tables available, we saw only one table  for organicmodel but similar tables are available for semi-detached and embedded models and itgives you a break up for the total development effort and the total development schedulein terms of the product design, the programming effort and integration and testing effort.So doing these  kind of things you could come out with a  conclusion and say that howlong will the system take to develop and how much analyst effort will be required, howmuch development effort will be required, how much coding effort will be required andapproximately when you will require this particular kind of a thing.<s> This data will be veryuseful for the top management for allocating resources to your project.<p>

Let us now divert our attention to the third technique, your use of network analysis forestimating the time required and the effort required for individual programs in the system.<p>

A very quick review of steps involved in network analysis:We are very familiar with things like work break down structure.<s> But first you need toenumerate the list of activities.<s> Once you got the list of activities  you  need to drawprecedence table,  you also know what precedence is, then you  can draw an activitydiagram, estimate the early, likely and late times for each of these particular activities soyou can use like Beta distribution kind of approach.<s> once you got this mean time requiredfor doing each of these particular activities you calculate  six different times  associatedwith the system as what you call the earliest even time and the latest even time associatedwith  this [even.39:35]  and latest starting time,  earliest  finishing time and latestfinishing time with each activity.<s> Once you got this data you can easily calculate theslacks and the flouts,  the slacks for the events and flouts for the activity time that youhave and you would get a critical path.<s> From the critical path you could always allocateresources and then convert the network into a scheduling network and  draw thecorresponding resources histogram.<p>
