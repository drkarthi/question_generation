The buyer has to typically end up placing an order for the article.<s> We need to be able torepresent an entity called an order which will have certain details associated with it, theorder number, payment details and so on.<s> One buyer can end up placing multiple ordersand this is illustrated with 1 to n kind of relationship and this is a places relationship.One buyer will end up placing multiple orders and each order can itself be associatedwith multiple articles.<s> Each order can be associated with multiple articles and then ofcourse the article might be published in a particular store.<s> So you can have a Published-In relationship and the source could have details of the name of journal, the name of thepublisher and so on.<s> Because these are the people to whom the money is going to becredited once the order is placed.<p>

The author would have also be represented would be just like you have the buyer beenrepresented on one side, you are going to have to represent an author.<s> In this case therecould be an  N  to  N  relationship.<s> What this means is that a single author can end upwriting multiple articles and a single article can be written by multiple authors.<s> Theauthor would have things like name, contact information that is address and so on.<s> This isan example of a structural diagram.<s> The diagram is not complete, but something that wecan do fairly easily.<s> This is an example of a structural diagram in which we haveillustrated the needs from a data perspective of a library system that is going to allow youto search for articles.<p>

Remember we are saying nothing  about a search in the data diagram; that is part of thefunctionality of the system.<s> What this is trying to primarily illustrate is, what are the datarequirements?<s> What are you going to end up storing in database at end of the day for sucha system?<s> You are going to store all the details of the articles, you are going to have tostore about the authors, publishers, the orders that come in and so on.<s> This is a semanticdata model for a library system.<s> Remember,  just like we had tabular forms of data thatcan supplement state transition diagram.<s> For example it described all the states,  itdescribed all the external and internal stimuli that this thing can end up corresponding to,but it gave a descriptive notation of it,  just like we had a diagram it could becomplemented by the descriptive notation.<p>
