The third thing which may be one of the hardest things to deal with which is just becauseit is something that is hard to get your hands around is something called as not inventedhere syndrome or the nix syndrome.<s> This basically deals with the programmers attitudethat they want to build everything as opposed to using something that somebody else hasconstructed for them it stems from  several sources and we will  not going in  to thatdiscussion here; this has kind of being well studied, several papers have been publishedin this area as well.<p>

Then the cost of maintaining a component library there are there is no well-known placethat you can go to buy software components;  certainly applications  are fairly welladvertised but if I had a particular need for a component there is no universal componentrepository or a library that again goes and searches for and find one of these things.<s> So itmay be something that you have maintain at your own site and  the cost of maintainingthis kind of a library becomes quite expensive and the same thing is what this last bullethere is talking about is finding and adopting reusable component.<p>

So adaptation is a different problem in the finding one.<s> So you may find one but it maynot it may not be something that suits your needs exactly and you may have to adapt tothat component you may have to in object oriented terms you may have to redefine someof the  interfaces  of that  component  which means you have to understand how thecomponent is put together internally that implies that it is no longer black box reuse thatyou are doing;  you are not kind of taking the whole component as it is and plugging itinto your  system but you have to take it apart to understand what it  is doing and thenredefine some of the pieces of ex-functionality so that it becomes appropriate for reuse.At the same time you might be deriving some benefit out of the whole thing because thecomponent exists and it has done some work for you already.<p>
