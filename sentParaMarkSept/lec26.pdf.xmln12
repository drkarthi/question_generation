Collective ownership: where it often what happens in software development processes isthat  a  group of developers get wedded to one or two modules  some x modules  of thesystem  and  they know  those modules very well but they  do  not  want  to  understand therest of the system at all and that proves very fatal because if those group of programmersleave or for some reasons they have to be moved out of the project then there is nobodyelse who understands that part of the system very well.<p>

So  what XP  does is try to introduce the practice  where  people move around differentmodules they are not wedded to one module of the system as a  result of which theytypically tend to get a good idea of all parts of the system and there is no  islands  ofknowledge that is going to end up developing.<p>

The next practice is continuous integration.<s> Continuous integration is one where multiplepeople changes code changes are brought together frequently.<s> So, typically twice a day ishow you end up tending to integrate and for every integration what is more important isto make sure that you test the integration; it is not just that you stored the code togetherand then you move on you have to measure that  it all  complies together so you mighthave interfaces that are being used by other people and it may not compile because youmade a change in the interface that is being used by somebody else; it also has to pass allthe tests;  it  just  not  has to compile but remember  that since the tests  have been writteneven before the code is being written it has to pass all the tests.<p>
