We can add certain operators to this, we can add new operations to this whole thing andwhat we essentially end up coming up with is, a more detailed representation of one ofthese data structures.<s> What it takes to get from an ADT or an abstract data type to aneffective class is really the specification itself and this is the unchanging part of it.<s> Thiscan be handed down to a developer for example and ask him to implement it.<p>

The developer has to make sure that when he implements, all the rules that are given inthe axioms have to be true.<s> You need some kind of a concrete representation at the end ofthe day and it gets turns into an executable piece of code and that needs to be a concreterepresentation.<s> In the case of the stack it can be implemented using arrays,  it can beimplemented using lists and so on.<p>

What you need now is also a mapping that goes from the abstract data type down to therepresentational capabilities that exist.<s> For an array you can do certain set ofmanipulations.<s> You have to make sure that for every operation that exists with theabstract data type,  you can map it down to the set of operations that are possible on aconcrete representation that you have chosen.<s> One of the important things that you haveto keep in mind is that this mapping essentially has to obey the axioms and they have tocheck for the preconditions that we have laid out in the notation itself.<s> The one importantthing that we will discuss pretty soon is the notion of abstract data type and informationhiding.<s> As you recall information hiding is an  important  characteristic  of  softwaremodularization.<p>
