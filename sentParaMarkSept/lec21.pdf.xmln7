Functionality:  There is an  important measure available in software engineering  calledfunction points (FP), which is computed in terms of number of external inputs, number ofexternal outputs,  number of external inquires,  number of external files,  number ofinternal files, you can change files interfaces and so on.<p>

But these different factors are taken in  to account and each counted entity has a weightassociated:  simple,  average and complex.<s> Say for example,  you have various externalinputs and some of them may be simple, some of them may be average and some of themcomplex.<s> This kind of measurement could be subjective.<s> One person may say thatsomething is complex and another person might put it as average.<s> So there is some kindof subjectivity associated here.<s> But you give these weights and then as per a table theseweights of these various numbers are picked and then with the formula you compute yourFP or your function points measure.So  this is one way to measure your functionality because we are talking about inputs,outputs, files used, or the different number of entities used, number of external inquiresinto your software.<s> So  you are trying to measure the functionality in some sense.<s> Thenanother good measure is a simple number of use cases in OOAD.<s> Complexity: We knowthat  we have the big O  notation and we have various kinds complexities  and  you cancompare them.<p>

Suppose you can  say that,  I  have a function  and  it  is a constant time algorithm.<s> Soirrespective of your input size it has same number of steps that have to be executed.<s> Youmay have a logarithmic, linear, quadratic and exponentially complex algorithm.<s> So onceyou measure  these you know how complex your algorithm is  and how the timings  aregoing to vary based on input sizes.<s> So  you basically measure  both  time and spacecomplexity,  you  may also want  to  say  the  space required  so that you can use yourresources effectively.<p>
