Therefore,  in this particular manner we can do the job for effort and on  exactly similarlines we can do this particular effort for schedule.<s> Therefore you see here that we got theparticular percentages of the total time required for doing the development and youmultiply by the time to develop that is 78 days and you get so many days for doing it.<s> Sowe can summarize and say that your product design for instance is going to take 8 days ofeffort spread over 15 days of time and your programming is going to take in 32 days ofeffort over  49  days of time.<s> And last but not least your 8  days of integration effort isgoing to be spread over 24 days.<p>

Let us not re-look at how we use the COCOMO approach.<s> To begin with we did a fairlydeep work  into our system to do a higher level design that is after getting therequirements we identified which are the main programs that we are going to write andwe came out with some kind of a run chart from which we could easily say that we aregoing to  have three programs;  the  update program,  the report program and the enquiryprogram.<s> Once we got this particular thing then we use the combination of Beta andDelphi  technique  assuming that we had more than one expert required  to do theestimation.<s> Actually this particular system is too small to required more than one expert.In case you required you could use it using Delphi approach or wide band Delphi or anysuch approach or may be  by using a single persons  estimation  we used  the  Betadistribution kind of  approach and we made minimum,  maximum and the  most likelyestimates in terms of the number of lines of code or delivered source of instructions foreach of the three programs the update program, report program and the query program.<p>
