Then of course there are many other constraints that we can define on the data basicallyconstraints capture the meaning,  what are the permitted values for the data,  is the dataunique,  do they have some interdependencies and many other restrictions that we mayimpose.<s> All these restrictions and other constraints and proper naming are very importantpart of conveying the meaning of data.<p>

Any model will have to provide such facilities by which the meaning is captured.<s> As wego along we will see  that the  models such as ER model provide facilities for thesedifferent types of expressions through which the semantics can be put down as the part ofthe model.<s> Let us talk about the entity relationship model in detail.<s> ER model has a fewconcepts.<s> It is  simple and easy to use.<s> It  permits to some extent a systematic top downapproach, so that various details can be controlled and you need not put down everythingat one point, you can convey it in a step by step fashion.<s> And because of these reasons itis an excellent tool for communication with the users.<s> (Refer Slide Time: 15:41)<p>

As we collect our requirements and we prepare the model, we can verify our model withthe user.<s> So that we know our conceptual design is correct and our understanding of datais correct.<s> For all these reasons the ER  model is known as a conceptual data model.<s> Itdoes not describe how the data will be stored or represented.<s> It only talks about what kindof data concepts are there and how they are interrelated.<s> It provides a powerfuldiagramming notation through which the model can be represented.<s> This diagrammingnotation and the simple concepts of entity and relationship are very  intuitive concepts.This is what makes the ER model very simple tool for communication with the users.<p>
