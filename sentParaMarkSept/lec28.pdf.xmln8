The  first thing is that you have an initial component interface that you start from.<s> Youhave built a component and what you need to do is to make this a generic component thecomponent you have built may have been for a specific project so the first thing that youhave to apply is the name generalization process.<s> there are plenty of people, for example,whose names include that of the package for which it is being built, whose names reflectthe company for which the code is being built, whose names reflect the application and soon so you should try and stay away from that as far as possible so name generalization isthe first thing that is done as part of this process.<p>

The second one is operational generalization.<s> And operational generalization as we haveseen before can  take two different forms: The first form is that of adding methods.<s> Bymethod we are referring to the object oriented term; adding interfaces would be a betterway of describing it.<s> One is  a specific interface is genericized.<s> So these are the twodifferent ways of doing operational generalization.<p>

The  next thing you may have to think  about is the exception generalization.<s> You  havealready seen these three things: the name generalization,  the operational generalizationand the exception generalization process.<p>

Once  you pass these steps one of the things that you would have to then do is tosignificantly improve the documentation of the component because if it is a componentthat you are going to use purely within your own project and you have written thecomponent then you probably do not need a whole new lot of documentation.<s> But, on theother hand, if somebody else is going to use this component then they would need a lot ofdocumentation because they may not necessarily understand your intent  when youdevelop the component.<s> Finally it has to go through a certification step which will checkall of the above:  is  it  generic enough,  does  it have good documentation,  is it robustenough, does it pass all the test that it says it is going to pass and so on and at the end ofthis process then is going to come a reusable component.<p>
