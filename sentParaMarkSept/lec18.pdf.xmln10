You can test the highest  level module directly.<s> You do  not need the driver only for thehighest level module.<s> Otherwise for all the modules, when you are coming from bottomupwards,  you need the drivers for all the upward layers.<s> So mainly you are going toaccount for the cost of  drivers.<s> Stubs are not needed when you have bottom upintegration.<s> So error in module A  gets detected in last stage because you are going toreach the main thread in the software or  the main control in software only at the end.There is another important testing strategy called  regression testing.<s> So we see thatsoftware undergoes changes.<s> What worked earlier may not work again with changes  tothe existing.<p>

When we make changes to something that already exist, what we had tested earlier maynot work again.<s> So we have to carry out the test cases again if there is any change and thetested modules depend on what has undergone changes.<s> It depends on the severity ofchanges and probably the variables  that you change,  the effects might be different.<s> Theeffects or the dependencies get propagated to the modules which are dependent on themodule that undergoes changes.<s> Some test cases are re-executed when changes occur inthe software.<s> Changes may be due to availability of new modules or changes in existingmodules.<s> So regression testing allows you to capture these changes and ask you to redothe test cases for all the affected modules.<p>

So you may have to carry out integration test again and again as the software changes dueto  availability of new modules and changes in existing modules.<s> Now,  we will look atsome techniques that are used to monitor the behavior of the program.<s> During the testingphase,  the program behavior is monitored,  so that a bug can be fixed based on theobserved behavior.<p>
