You can say functionally cohesive  is the best cohesion.<s> We  are  putting all thecomponents together, so that is the best cohesion.<s> Coincidental cohesion is just they aretogether, but it is not really cohesion.<s> We have put some of the classes.<s> There are variousclasses in which you can define the cohesion and you can say one is better than the other.So  the best is the cohesion  where,  which is due to abstraction.<s> So  you  are  puttingcomponents together because they are achieving some related functionality andabstraction of the module is one  and  that is the best cohesion possible.<s> So there is onesuch scale available.<p>

But you can also measure cohesion in terms of your code for example you can try to findout whether a class can be partitioned into two, by partitioning the classes functions intotwo.<s> Partition  such  that,  each set of functions uses  different set of variables.<s> If it  ispartition able in that way, then the class is not cohesive or you can find out whether classis highly cohesive or not so cohesive.<s> So there is measure available in object orientedsoftware metrics suite for measuring lack of cohesion.<p>

Now,  we are going to have a  slide on the  object oriented metrics.<s> The object orientedcommunity has come up with quite a few metrics which can measure your object orienteddesign and object oriented software or object oriented code.<p>
