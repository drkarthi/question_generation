This may look something like a state transition diagram.<s> It may be a data processingmodel or a DFT diagram and so on.<s> In fact there are two types of behavioral models thatwe can consider.<s> Data processing models is one of them.<s> Just like we saw the businessprocess flow model or the process model, a  data processing model here focuses on themovement of data from one system to another in the course of satisfying the exact samebusiness process that we talked about.<s> And then on the other hand, we take a look at theinside of each module now and say, what  is  the different kind of external stimuli thismodule  is going to react to?<s> And  for  each external stimulus what kind of reaction is itgoing to have?<s> Is it going to move to a different state etc?<s> Both of these perspectives aretypically required because they show different perspectives in the systems behavior.<s> Andboth of them are required and they go together to form a good behavioral model.<p>

Data processing models are also called data flow diagrams or DFT diagrams and they areused to model system data processing capabilities.<s> We just talked about the flow of dataand the transformation of data as well.<s> Data, for example going from one step to another,the equipment specification of the previous procurement process that we saw might havethe specification itself is a piece of data that now has to be evaluated.<s> Once this isvalidated there may be certain changes that are done to the specification.<s> Once that isdone, it is converted into some kind of order form and so on.<p>
