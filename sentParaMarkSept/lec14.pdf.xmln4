This book  talks about reusable design.<s> Incidentally reusable design does not directlyimply that corresponding code is also reusable as it is.<s> But at the level of design, at leastyou should be able to reuse and if there is code reuse that is also possible.<s> Most oftenyour entities might be different and you have specialized behavior.<s> The amount of codereuse that you can have in your system sometimes is limited because of variousconsiderations.<s> But the point is that one has to learn to reuse your results of your olddesign processes if there are similar requirement.<s> So you are reusing design and you arealso reusing the design processes, because once you do design again and again, you alsodevelop the process of designing.<s> You also know how to go about decomposition.<s> So theprocess also gets reused along with the product.<s> So reuse is an  important factor in yourdesign.<p>

Now the next factor is; is the design well structured?<s> How good the design is?<s> Is there agood decomposite or is it very haphazard?<s> Is it very hard to understand the design?<s> Arethere are two many interactions?<s> One does  not know where to start such designs is notgood.<s> You need to have a well structured design.<s> We are going to see later in this lectureabout what kind of structure  they are.<s> Another factor that goes into designing is theevolvability  of your design.<s> Is it evolvable?<s> This is very important because therequirements also keep on changing quite often<p>

Sometimes you have not considered all of them in one shot.<s> You will know it down theline  and  you need to evolve  your design.<s> So when you are designing, during  that timeitself you must design such that the design is evolvable and one should be able to make achange into it very easily.<s> There are techniques to build evolvable a design.<s> For example,if you have already structured your different entities into a nice inheritance hierarchy, youwill be able to add a new subclass into inheritance hierarchy and evolve the design.<s> If youalready have a modular design,  you  will be able to add a new module into design.<s> Youhave to take into account future additions and future changes.<p>
