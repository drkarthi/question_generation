The database of external suppliers that exist will be used to find a particular supplier.<s> Theboxes are essentially illustrating the different databases there are two kinds of databaseswhich is the supplier and the equipment database.<s> The different ovals here are tryingto indicate business process steps.<s> The first step in the procurement of the equipment isthat you have to specify the specification the equipment that you want to procure.<s> Thenext step is somebody has to validate that specification to say; yes this is indeed what wewant to get.<p>

And at the same time two arrows going out of the same box indicates that it can be donein parallel.<s> Somebody can go find the list of suppliers that can supply the equipment thatwe want to buy.<s> And eventually once its validated and once we get the list of supplierswe can get the cost estimates.<s> We might put out request and that point in time differentpeople may end up biding, and different equipment suppliers may end up biding, so weend up biding cost estimates.<s> Once we get the cost estimates we typically end upchoosing a supplier which is another step in the business process.<s> Once the supplier ischosen we end up placing an order.<s> Once the order has been placed the delivery is taken.And once the equipment has been delivered, you enter it into your equipment database.<p>

Here is an example of a business process that helps you during the requirementsengineering phase actually communicate with the customer as to what is the system goingto be doing .The system in this case is being built to automate an equipment procurementprocess.<s> There are certain data requirements of which we have not really focused on inthis case.<s> We have primarily focused on the flow of control that exists within the businessprocess.<s> All the way from the specification of the equipment that is to be purchased orprocured, all the way through taking delivery of that equipment and then entering into theequipment database or the inventory database that you might have within your company.Behavioral models on the other hand show on how the system is itself ends up reacting tocertain external stimuli, meaning what is the behavior of the system going to be like.<p>
