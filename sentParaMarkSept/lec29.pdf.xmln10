Now,  when we have  defined  the life cycle  we  have  basically two aspects:  there areprojects phases and there are  project activities.<s> The  project is  divided into series ofphases.<s> Phases  basically we say is something that we visit once whereas activities aresomething that are performed on an  ongoing basis.<s> Now let  us look at the phases of asoftware project.<p>

Typically requirements,  design,  programming and testing are the  fields.<s> What are theexamples of the activities?<s> These are the examples of  activities.<s> Now look at the fewthings that come in.<s> For instance, requirements seem to design, programming appears onboth the sides.<s> Now understand what we are doing.<s> When you are in a requirement spaceyou are doing several activities including identifying the requirement.<s> Projectmanagement is another activity which is going on and there are several other things likemaking certain documentations that are going on.<s> So a phase consists of many activities,a phase consists of many activities and sometimes the dominant phase sometimes thedominant phase sorry the dominant activity in a phase often is named as the phase.<p>

Now let us take the design as activity.<s> The design activity is dominant during the designphase.<s> But  in  case you find some mistakes the requirement activity may have to berepeated during the design phase.<s> So  on  and so forth for programming,  testing,  andquality  assurance.<s> So project management,  quality assurance,  estimation  these  thingsnever appear as phases their activities are undertaken probably in all of these particularphases  the activities which are undertaken  during.<s> so individual activities mayoverlap in several phases but the phases normally do not repeat; the phases do not repeat;phases do not repeat.<p>
