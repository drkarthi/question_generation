You can organize your programmers  according to architectural partitioning.<s> It becomeseasier to handle the system if architecture is available or if architectural approach is takenat the beginning.<s> And then it also promotes reuse by componentization.<s> In architecture, ifyou identify a few components which are already built, then you benefit from their reuse.When you are architecting a system, you have to also take into account similar productswhich have been written earlier in your organization or which are available through thirdparties or they could be say class libraries and packages and so on.<p>

When you draw your architectural diagrams, when you do your architectural analysis, atthat time you can benefit from what is existing  and  you have to also do an analysis ofreuse.<s> Those reusable components, packages or whatever entities you are reusing in yourarchitecture depends on what level of architectural you are handling.<s> If it is highest levelof architecture,  there could be highest level of architectural components which arereusable.<s> So at that level one has to identify what you are going to reuse and what you aregoing to build.<s> Hence architecture is very important from reuse perspective.<p>

And again,  when you are architecting a  system you might also take into account futurereuse in a given product line.<s> A  product improves over  time because requirements getrefined and refined over versions.<s> Then bugs get found out, and then you might want toreengineer some parts of the system  and so on.<s> A  product always improves in terms offunctionality,  performance,  its correctness and so on.<s> So architecture becomes veryimportant it plays a major role in a product line.<s> Evolution is another important aspectthat benefits from architecture  which is changes and dependencies in the system.<s> TheOverall dependencies among the modules are identified in the architecture or thedependencies among the components that have been identified in the architecture.<p>

The architecture also draws the evolution process.<s> Product can evolve due to versioningor it could be due to specialization and so on.<s> We are going to subsequently discussdifferent kinds of architectural patterns.<s> Some of these ideas will come again when welook at some specific example of patterns of architecture.<s> What are the basic principleswhich are applied by architects?<p>
