And as we have seen in one of the Lehmans law as the program ages and more and morechanges are made to it the complexity just explodes at some point in time and making anyfurther changes is going to prove very very costly.<s> So the problems that face maintainerstypically are  again as a result of poorly followed processes during development largelythat is one thing, so poor documentation; people just developers just do not take the timeand the effort to document what is it that they are coding; is the design documented?<s> Isthe architecture documented; is the code documented; are there proper user manuals forthis; does it give all the exceptional conditions that can arise in a software and so on.<p>

The second thing is user demand.<s> Once the software is put in front of a user theyimmediately start asking for changes because they realize.. oh!<s> this could have beendone like this,  I wanted this particular feature instead of this one that you provided.<s> Somaintenance typically get inundated with request  from users the moment that it kind ofhits the users screens.<s> So therefore there is difficulty in meeting schedule commitmentsso lot of commitments would have to be made in that point in time; new version of thesoftware have to be developed;  the software is going to evolve from perspective offeature side itself but then there are all these other minor changes that had to be made aswell and therefore both of these have to be put into some kind of a schedule that can beworked.<p>

Also turn over and user organizations we already talked about.<s> So here is a small examplebasically a software has m components and we need to change the key of the componentsthen the number of interfaces that we would have to check for impact are significant as itcan be seen here: so k star m minus k is really the number of interfaces that would haveto be changed and each interface would end up interacting with the others as well.<s> So lotof the effort can essentially be attributed to lack of user understanding.<s> For  any oneperson to understand this complexity is typically impossible and when there are multiplepeople and there is turn over in the organization all of these are compound factors.<s> So thisis also something that we have seen earlier as  what are the different approaches tomaintenance.<p>
