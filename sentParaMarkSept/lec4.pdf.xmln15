If necessary the modules on the level two such as the processing module can be decomposedfurther.<s> So the hierarchy can consist of multiple levels.<s> Depending on the complexity we cankeep decomposing till we arrive  at  a  module which is clearly specified, and which can beimplemented in terms of a  coding code module which can be converted into a  program.<s> Themodules  at higher level generally do the coordination  and control, whereas the modules at thelower levels do input/output and computations.<s> This is exactly what we saw in the previousdiagram.<s> The module at the higher level which was the Task 1 is the one which gets work donefrom the modules at lower level.<s> So it obtains inputs, it obtains computational results and itpasses them from one module to another module.<s> So the task of coordination and control usuallygets done at the modules at the higher level, whereas the modules at the lower level you canthink of them as worker modules.<s> They actually perform the tasks such as the input/output tasksand the computational tasks.<p>

Structure chart also shows important data.<s> As we just now saw these data are shown as flowingbetween the different modules.<s> There may be either data  coming into the module or the datagoing out from the module to the calling module.<s> Usually you do not show the control flow inthe structure chart.<s> However some important control flow or structures such as decision makingand iterations may also be shown on a structure chart without giving too many details.<p>

In fact this is only to indicate to the reader of the structure chart, that some modules may berepeatedly executed, whereas some modules may be executed only depending on certaincondition.<s> The few notational extensions are made to the structure chart as shown in the diagram.Here the diagram at the top shows iteration.<s> It shows that module A may be repeatedly call onmodules C and D. The diagram  at the bottom has  a  small diamond here which indicates thatmodule  A  will call module C or D depending on some condition.<s> In fact the details of thecondition  are details of how often the iteration would be done are not given on the structurechart.<s> It only shows that such an iteration or decision making is present in the software.<s> Andthese  are the important repetitions or iterations  and the important decisions which are made inthe software functions.<p>
