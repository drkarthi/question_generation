So there are things that you would have to keep a watch out for in order to figure out as towhen is the right time to kind of replace  software  if you will just like you do forhousehold  appliance that we talked about before.<s> So in summary  what we see is thatsoftware maintenance and evolution is a  very very important aspect of the overall lifecycle  of  the software, it  is not just development that has to be given importance theprocess of software evolution,  the tools that are required,  so cm tools may be required,cm processes configuration management processes may be required,  the changemanagement process is required;  it is important to keep a  continuity between thedevelopment staff who  developed  the  original system and the  people  who  end upmaintaining it; it is important to keep good level of documentation and so on.<s> So all ofthese contribute towards the maintainability of the software at the same time you have tobe able to predict  based  on the  historical data as to how much of maintenance you aregoing to be able to withstand on a  particular system so that it can evolve  to the nextgeneration,  it can  be  replaced with a newer system which can kind of start the  wholecycle from the beginning.<p>

In summary again this is a very very important aspect of the lifecycle of the software andis very important to study.<p>
