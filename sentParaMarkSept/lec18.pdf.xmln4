So at any level you can apply this strategy of black box testing and this black box testingdoes not take into account the internals of the artifact that you have chosen at the givenlevel.<s> It could be the entire software or it could be a module or one class or one instanceand so on.<s> The second approach that we get based on the internal view is that of the whitebox testing.<s> So white box testing is based on the insiders view of the given artifact.<s> Sayfor example, you have the code with you and you want to check whether all parts in thegiven code lead to correct answer  or whether all branches are covered.<s> You want togenerate such test cases based on white box testing or the internals of given module or theimplementation.<s> So you get these two different approaches,  black box and white boxtesting.<s> We will look at these two a bit closely.<p>

So here we see that black box testing is also called functional testing, that is because youare going to mainly look at the functionality of the black box, how it is to be used as ablack box.<s> You are not seeing inside or you are not looking at the internal structure.<s> Youare looking only the externally observable functionality and test the artifact from externalpoint of view.<s> Specs are used to generate test data.<s> For example, specs of a given module:What is the contract that a given module supports?<s> Let us take this sorter.<s> It sorts data ordata items.<s> Sorting function or the sorter will be taking some input and produces sortedoutput.<p>

How will you test this sorter?<s> You might generate a test case based on this black boxpolicy.<s> That means look at only the input and the output, do not look at the code of thesorter.<s> Do not try to test the integrity of the code itself.<s> Only look at the input and outputand generate your test.<s> You are going to only sample the entire space through input andoutputs of a given module or a black box.<s> So here a simple test case could be a specificset of data as input and see whether the data item get sorted.<s> Data can also be generatedrandomly based on input types.<s> Once you know the types of inputs,  you can generaterandom data and these random data can detect some class of bugs.<p>
