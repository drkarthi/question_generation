So this is a verifiable non functional requirement that is being introduced into this systemwith the goal of trying to improve the general productivity of the organization of thesystem for which the system is being built.<s> It is useful to have both goals and functionalrequirements and non functional requirements as part of  the requirements document,because the goals convey a sense of what the user intends to do with the system and thisis always going to be useful to the software developer, the designer in putting together thesystem itself.Here is an example of the differentiation between a goal and a verifiable non functionalrequirement.<s> The goal is that the system should be easily used by experienced controllersand it should be organized in such a way that user errors get minimized.<p>

And how do you turn this into a verifiable non functional requirement is that, the peopleexperienced controllers who have a good idea of the domain, should be able to catch upwith the system functionality with less than two days of training, or two hours of trainingin  this particular example,  and after this training,  average number of errors that areperformed by the human operators during the system should not exceed two per day.<s> Sothis is a very quantified requirement, it is very precise and its a non functional prcisedrequirement and that kind of takes the broad goal that has been laid out for  building ausable and human friendly system and lays it down to more precise language of being averifiable requirement.<p>
