Once  we  got this particular kind of a thing  the next particular thing was to plug thenumber of lines of code into  the  COCOMO organic equations to get the effort estimatefor  man months and to get a TDEV the Time to Develop estimate and from that alsomake an estimate for the full-time software personnel required for doing this particularkind of a job.<p>

The next step was we had adjustment factors,  the product attributes,  the  computerattributes, personnel attributes and the project attributes.<s> We ranked our system on eachof these  particular attributes and multiplied by the cost driver effort multiplier that wasgiven in a standard  table and came out  with  a  total adjustment factor noting that theadjustment factors are multiplicative in nature.<s> In that particular sense we got a numberand once we had that particular thing we could calculate the unadjusted man month effortfor developing this particular system.<p>

Now we also saw that man months could be converted into man days and the TDEV inmonths  could  be converted to number of working days.<s> We could manipulate theseparticular working days by working either five days a week or six days a week and youcould possibly think of working seven days a week also,  you can think of working 1  shifts  or 12Hr  shifts  etc.<s> But basically remember that  the working days have to be theanchor for our calculations.<p>

Doing this particular thing we will see  that the development production  will remain thesame irrespective of working five days a week or six days a week and our developmentproductivity turned out to be about 411 lines of delivered  source coded  instructions perman month of effort.<s> Thus with the conclusion that we can now assign work to differentgroups of people at different point of time we could go ahead.<s> In case you were to use thenext level of COCOMO you  can also get activity-wise  break up for each developmentstage.<p>
