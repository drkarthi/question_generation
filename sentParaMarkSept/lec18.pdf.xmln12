You can write an assert statement just at the beginning of a function, on the parametersthat are sent into the function.<s> So you are going to use assertions on the input, you canuse them as preconditions.<s> Or you can use them as post conditions, after the function iscompleted just before you return the value,  check or validate the value.<s> Write yourassertion on the desired post effect.<s> For example if you have an operation such as push ona stack.<s> After the code for push is completed, you have to assert that the size of the stackgoes by one and the element has gone on top of the stack.<s> So we can write appropriateassert statements  as preconditions and post conditions.<s> Precondition is before the actualbusiness logic is completed and post condition is asserted after that business logic iscompleted.<p>

Then you could also have assertions as invariants over given scope.<s> A specific conditionwhich always is true for the entire life time of the object or of the module, for example: Astack with fixed size could have size less than or equal to its capacity.<s> You cannot havemore number of elements than the maximum capacity of the stack when the storage isstatic.<s> These invariants over a given scope could be of different kinds.<s> They could beclass invariants, for a given class you can identify the invariant conditions.<s> There couldbe loop invariants.<s> There  could be module invariants for a module  or set of functions.There could be system invariants for the entire system.<s> The conditions that always hold tobe true for given scope; for a given class, for inside a loop, inside a module and for theentire system.So till it could be a class invariant,  object invariant  and  when the loop is executed  orduring the life time of that loop, the invariant holds true.<s> So one can use these assertionsvery effectively in program design and also carry them over into implementation usingthe assertion  support  provided by a given programming language.<s> All modernprogramming languages now  support assertions  through different mechanisms.<s> Therealso higher level assertion techniques,  higher level extensions to these languages whichare available.<s> There are many papers also available on assertions; how to use them, whatdifferent kinds of assertions are there and where should they be used.<s> So  this is animportant technique for defense  programming.<s> If you use an assert statement one cancatch bugs, when the assertion detects the  failure or when we  fail to assert a givencondition at that point of execution.<s> Now another question that we have to see is, how areyou going to evaluate your output?<s> Is the output of a test correct?<p>
