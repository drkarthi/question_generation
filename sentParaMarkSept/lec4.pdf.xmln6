All these responsibilities are also clearly stated briefly in this section so introduction section is anoverview of the documents purpose, and the references responsibilities.<s> These are clearly statedand this is the first section of the SRS document.<s> The next section is the general description ofthe software that we plan to develop.<s> It first contains the product perspective.<s> Here we see theproduct  as  a  single unit and try to establish its overall context.<s> We see it as  a  black box; howdoes it relate to possibly other software products?<s> What  are its interfaces with the otherproducts?<p>

Then it states the functions of the product briefly.<s> These are the general overview of varioustasks that the product is supposed to perform, including references to data  flow diagrams.<s> Thisproduct function overview is an overview of the functionality of the software.<s> We then try tocharacterize the users for whom the software is being developed and we also mention thedifferent constraints which are placed.<s> These constraints may be about the schedule ofdevelopment, resources such as the existing system and software packages, constraints about thecost and other resources.<s> The section 2 of the SRS document is a general description given notonly the overview of the products features, but also placing it in its proper context in terms ofother products, in terms of users who will use what characteristics we can assign to these users,in terms their expertise and training and so on.<p>

Section 3 is really the core part of the document.<s> In this part we give functional details.<s> Wedefine every function of the software, by giving a  brief introduction to this function.<s> Then wedescribe the inputs to the function, processing and the outputs.<s> So these functions may bedifferent functions that the software will perform.<s> For example, it may be  a  function related toreserving  a  seat on a  train or cancellation of a  ticket  already booked.<s> So these are differentfunctions or tasks.<s> Each of them needs certain inputs, performs some processing and producessome output.<s> For every such function, we give description in this particular section.<s> So section 3is really the body of the SRS document where functions are described in full details.<p>
