Can you show how an entity in the entity relationship model has been mapped on toanother design entity?<s> You should be able to show whether it has gone as an attribute in aclass or has it become a class itself or some collections of entities and relations beingmapped to tables or they being designed as separate table.<s> In your data flow diagrams orthe data flow model,  are the processes being mapped to functions or they processesservers which are active servers?<s> A server typically goes in a loop.<s> It is open for requestas soon as it gets a request it operates on the request and sends response back.<s> So youhave to trace this analysis into your design.<p>

Why is this important?<s> First of all the design is banking on the analysis model.<s> Theanalysis has to be converted into design and then whoever wants to understand analysisand design, has to go through this if it is traceable directly.<s> Again this traceability has tobe seamless.<s> If you use the same methodology for design and analysis you might benefitfrom seamlessness.<s> For example if you apply object oriented analysis  and  designprocess, then  use the same notations  and same meta models for both  your analysis andyour design.<s> Then there is seamlessness.<s> When you further refine the analysis that youhave already came up with, it will get transformed into design.<s> So it has to be firsttraceable.<s> If possible, it could become seamless which is an additional advantage.<p>

Now, when you design are you designing everything from scratch or are you going toreuse  something  which you already have?<s> This is another important factor that youconsider when you design your software.<s> When a software firm takes up a project, it maynot be the first time that it has taken up a project unless it is a startup firm.<s> You carry outdesign often for different kind of projects and different products.So when you get something new, you would look at your earlier results or earlier designsrather than starting  from scratch to design.<s> Are you going to benefit from your earlierdesign?<s> If you have encountered similar situation earlier,  you have to bank on some ofthe results of your earlier design process.<s> But how do you reuse is another question.<p>
