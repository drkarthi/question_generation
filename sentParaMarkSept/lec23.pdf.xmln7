Now the feasibility step for the circulation project has the goal of identifying possiblesolutions and evaluating them and all these has to be done in limited time which is twoweeks and in limited cost and effort.<s> We do not want to spend more than what has beenbudgeted for this project.<s> So keep this in mind that when the development is being doneby an external agency, this time and cost will be very important criteria and they must dothe feasibility keeping this in mind.<s> So you would avoid going into unnecessary detailsbut at the same time,  you would like to come up with sufficient background of theapplication so that you can work out the cost, schedule, the development, effort and so onand give a few alternatives to the user.<s> So we start by clearly understanding theobjectives.<s> We have the first problem definition document as a source for us where wehad also identified who are the users.<p>

We want to take up the study of the existing system first where we would like to studywhat kind of tasks are performed  and why is the problems failed.<s> Why  do we think orwhy do we feel that the present system is inefficient and its also costly?<s> So as we studythe existing system and collect more and more data, at the back of our mind we will alsotry to keep those problems and see whether a logical model can be worked out for thenew system which we can suggest to the user.<s> So a some kind of proposed system is anobjective of a feasibility and a few alternatives would be given.<s> For each alternative wewill analyze all types of feasibilities for those such as technical feasibility and economicfeasibility and finally the phase will end by making a clear recommendation.<p>

Now  while  doing the  study of the existing system,  we will naturally be talking to thevarious  users of the system.<s> These  as we said earlier include the system librarian,  thecounter clerks and also the student and staff who borrow books from the library.<s> We willtry to find out what tasks are performed in the circulation function.<s> How  is the datahandled and what is the reason for the various problems?<s> So  here is the list of taskperformed.<s> So as we study the existing system, we get a good idea of the different taskswhich are taking place.<s> These  are issuing a book,  return a book,  claming a book if thebook is not readily available we may put a claim so that as soon as it is returned, we willbe able to get that books from the library.<p>
