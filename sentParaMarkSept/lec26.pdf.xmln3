So  the benefits of prototyping then are improved system usability because of thefeedback that is got in from the user very early on.<s> also the requirements are going to bemuch clearer  as  a result of which the output or  the  end  product of this entire processmatches the users needs very well;  the design quality is highly improved because youhave actually had the time to take a look at several choices not just take a look at them onpaper but try out the several choices and then pick the one that is right for you.<s> Also, themaintainability is good because this is not code that is reused; all the testing that you havekind of during the design phase of the  software engineering lifecycle  so you wanted  toplug in different algorithms and  see which one is the best one and you mightincrementally  change some of that.<s> now all of this can be thrown away because theprototype can be thrown away and when you start development for the real system youknow exactly what is to be done so  the code is much better return and therefore  muchmore maintainable.<p>

And overall in fact can reduce in in fact it can actually reduce the development effort orthe development work that is to be done, it may even result in the system being deliveredfaster  because the actual coding lifecycle and the  testing part of the lifecycle  which  isvery very important which can take very long can get reduced because the quality of thecode is much better so those are some of the benefits of prototyping.<p>
