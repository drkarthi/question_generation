We would not go into clean room development at this point of time.In  the next lecture we will take a look at this  process called clean room softwaredevelopment, whose philosophy mainly is that if it can be done right  for the first timethen that is the way we should go.We should not try to develop software fast with some errors and then come back and fixit rather we should take the additional amount of time in order to do it appropriately.<s> Theword clean room is borrowed from the chip development or the  chip manufacturingprocess in which clean room development is done.So you start from scratch always and you do not incorporate things from outside and soon.<s> We will go into the detail of the process in the next lecture.<p>

This is it about verification/validation.<s> It is a very important process that has to beappropriately put into the various phases of the software development life cycle.<s> It cannotall be done in the end and it cannot all be done in the beginning.<s> It is something that hasappropriate steps during the development life cycle itself and then care has to be taken tosee that this is part of the planning for the software project.<p>
