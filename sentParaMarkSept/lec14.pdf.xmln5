There are different properties of specific design that goes into these main or major highlevel properties such as evolvability, for example coupling, cohesion and so on.<s> These areactually software metrics and which is not focus of todays lecture.<s> We are going look atthe basic core properties or the basic considerations in the design.<s> In order to achieve anevolvable design, it has to be well documented.<s> You must produce all the importantdocuments of the design.<s> There are diagrammatic notations, you may also have text baseddescription, and you may also specify your designs.<s> There must not be any dark matterleft out.<s> If you document well, the rest can follow up on the documentation.<p>

Document should not be written for the sake of documentation.<s> It is for the sake of all thegoodness properties that you want to extract from a design  such as,  evolvabilitymaintainability  and understandability.<s> You have to produce proper documentation.<s> Howto document top down approach must be taken.<s> You must have high level document sothat first quickly you can grasp what the system is.<s> After you grasp the whole system, youcan then zoom on to specific sub systems and then understand the system.<s> Another factoris; has the design been reviewed?<s> This in fact is about the process of design.<s> You have toreveal your design so that you must make sure that it is complete and you are not missedout anything.<s> So this is an important aspect of your design process.<s> Now, we will look atthe important process that you apply in designing complex system.The important criteria or the important activity that you carry out when you want todefeat the complexity is by decomposition.<s> You cannot get the entire design in one shot.You cannot start writing down the lowest level details of your design.<s> Decomposition isvery important and that is the way to beat any complexity.<p>
