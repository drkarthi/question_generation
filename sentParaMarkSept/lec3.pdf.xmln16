Object oriented paradigm is very useful and has occupied very important position in thedesign of software.<s> And it simplifies greatly,  the  complex software development.<s> It hasnot only a new notion of a class as a unit for organizing the processing  as well as thestructure, but it provides a concept of inheritance which allows us to reuse the softwarefrom other existing components.<s> We use class diagrams to show the static structure of thesystem.<s> The class diagram identifies what are these different class components.<p>

And besides the class diagram, we use interaction diagram which indicate the  dynamicbehavior of the system in terms of classes interacting with each other.<s> So we will see thisobject oriented approach subsequently in much more details.<s> The only point we want tomake here is that there are different ways in which the design can be approached.<s> It couldbe the conventional approach where the architecture consists of functional modulesdepicted in the form of a structure chart or it could be an object oriented approach.<s> Objectoriented approach will decompose also large system into various packages.<s> So theprinciples are similar that you use the decomposition technique into convert the largesoftware into smaller components these components may be modules or they may beclasses and we organize the data and processing among these.<p>

Once we have completed the design and also have finalized the approach we can prepareour design document which also has a well defined structure.<s> The design document willgenerally include these different sections which will specify the design completely.<s> Westart by giving an overall introduction when we define the problem for which the designhas been prepared.<s> If necessary we indicate here the different such as data flow diagrams,entity relationship diagrams or class diagrams which have been prepared by us and weenclose them as appropriate annexure.<s> Then we define the software structure in terms ofthe architectural diagrams.<s> We define the data in terms of various database structures, thefiles or any other important data structures.<p>
