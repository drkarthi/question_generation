The purpose of the data store,  all  the different data items it contains can be clearlydefined.<s> Besides defining the data store you should also clearly mark the data flowsindicating what type of data goes from one point in the data flow diagram to anotherpoint.<s> Some of  the processes here you may want to refine further and decompose anddraw a second level data flow diagram.<s> Here is an example.<s> We might want todecompose the process 5  which we had shown in  the previous data flow diagram.<s> Thisprocess achieves a sale.<s> It is making a sale of a car.<s> How can we decompose this, whatdoes it consist of?<s> So we have listed the  sub processes which make up the process 5  Making a sale  Using these sub processes which are listed here you should be able todraw a decomposition of this as a data flow diagram of second level.<s> The constituents ofprocess 5 would be the following.<p>

Take buyer requirements add other details about his name and address and so onand validate this.Then  list cars which match the customers requirement.<s> For example, he maywant to purchase a zen with red color.<s> So you should be able to make this query to yourdatabase and list all cars which are matching in their age, color, make, manufacturer, andso on.<s> Out of these then the customer will consider a few.The third sub process is showing the repair history and the car history.The fourth sub process is registering the sale and negotiated price.The fifth process is computing the commission for the salesman.<p>

These are the five sub processes which make up the process 5 which we had shown in theprevious first level data flow diagram.<s> I will leave it as a simple exercise for you toprepare the decomposition of this process  into a second level data flow diagram wherethese processes would be shown as 5.1,5.2 etc.<s> We also need to prepare the data model.Now we have completed this model and you should be able to understand the ERdiagram which is shown for the same car mart example.<p>
