What is the use of a contextual model or the external perspective or why is it useful totake an external perspective?<s> These are  used to  essentially illustrate the operationalcontext of the system.<s> By this,  we  mean that we are trying to differentiate what theboundary of the system is,  from that it  just  lays outside the boundary.<s> We are trying toscope out the system and saying  that  given a particular systems requirements this iswhere the boundary lies.<s> For example the ERP system that we considered earlier youcould say that anything that has to do with processing the inventory, putting things intothe inventory system, taking things out of the inventory system and so on for example, ispart of the ERP system.<p>

But anything that has to do with costing,  accounting,  the purchasing,  the logistics ofpurchasing and so on, do not fall into this systems.<s> They form part of the external contextof the system within which the system operates  There may be certain social andorganizational concerns that may actually help us to decide where to position the systemboundaries.<s> For example if the accounting department wants to keep their systemsentirely separate and that may be a decision factor into where the system boundary for theERP system or the logistic planning of the system will lie.<s> Then the different models thatcan be constructed here will also show the relationship of the contextual models with thevarious other systems that may exist within the environment.<s> Here is an example of anATM or Automatic Teller Machine system that is being constructed.The auto teller system is the one that exists in the centre of the figure and the other boxesshows various other systems that this Auto-teller system ends up interacting with.<p>
