Here reviews are a technique which can be applied to non code products.<s> For instance; aproject plan,  estimates  you can look at a service document,  user manual,  test plans etc.All these particular documents are not in the code form then they are never going to becompiled and never going to be in that sense tested.<s> And in the early days that is what theproblem was.<s> You  really never formally conformed  that these  particular products wereokay.<s> So there are wide ranges of review techniques that are available.<s> They range fromvery  rigorous  kind of techniques like sudden  inspection to relatively not so rigoroustechniques like a walk through.<p>

Obviously the amount of time, money and effort that you are going to spend in review isgoing to be directly proportional to the likely consequence of an error.<s> So upfront whenyou are doing upstream software engineering like SRS and design the reviews are morerigorous because each of the requirement errors for instance can have a very significantdamage to the project as the time passes.<s> We have already seen two principles.<s> One is thetime between making the fault and detecting the fault increases then the cost of correctingthe fault also increases.<p>

Very frankly review is also a testing technique in that sense but when we normally talk oftesting we are taking of testing the code and the techniques like unit testing, integrationtesting, system testing and acceptance testing and in case of products alpha testing, betatesting and various testing techniques white box, black box etc can be used.<s> Now it is notenough to do a QC on a [product.53:31] look at one individual fault and let go ahead it.The QC data can be analyzed  in more detail and there are  various analysis techniqueswhich are available where the QC data can be put to  valuable use.<s> There are  threetechniques that we often use; the Pareto charts, control charts, fishbone diagram etc.<p>

Please  remember these are not the exclusive list of all possible analysis techniques wehave.<s> But the QC data needs to be analyzed in a very great deal of details.<p>
