The thing to be  noted here is, the things like branch accounting system,  the securitysystem, the accounting database and so on are not subsystems of the Auto-teller system,so in that  sense it is not an architectural diagram.<s> Basically it is  showing the otherexternal system.<s> For example the security system may be common with not just the Auto-teller machine system,  but all the other systems that may exist within the bankinginstitution for example a physical teller logging into his or her console may also end updealing with the security system.<s> Same thing is the account database,  the account database obviously is something that is common to pretty much all aspects of the bank andthat is shared  by various other systems.<s> What this kind of a diagram or a contextualmodel serves to do is, to position the system that is going to be built, which in this case itis going to be the Auto-teller system in relation to the other systems that this is going toend up interacting with during the course of its lifetime.<p>

Having talked a little bit about contextual models we would not go very much deeper intothat.<s> It is  mainly a high level modeling technique that is used to just position theboundaries of the system, so that we know exactly where to cut it off in terms of, if wehave a doubt or ambiguity in the requirements we should be modeling.<s> For examplesecurity,  we should be focusing on the security of the system,  this clearly shows that asystem such as a security system or  the accounting system is going to be outside thebounds of the Auto-teller system in this particular example.<s> Process models on the otherhand basically show the overall business processes that are supported by the system.What do we mean by business process?<p>
