The form based specifications like  I said earlier, do lends  itself  to  a  certain degree ofmodularization.<s> So you can assume that there are a set of modules in the system, for eachone we are specifying what the module is going to be doing, not how it is going to do it.This is typically done using a set of inputs to the module, a set of outputs to the module isexpected to generate,  and if it is dependant on any other module in the system  forexample, any kind of preconditioned inputs which needs to be validated by the module,for example if we were giving a name then it usually cannot be having numericalcharacters in it.<s> This could be an example of a precondition, which will validate a pieceof input coming in.<s> And the side effects if any, of each one of these modules or functionswithin the modules themselves,  are typically how forms are put together.<s> Tabularspecifications really supplement the form based specification and tabular specification isespecially useful when a number of conditions would have to be specified.<s> And based onthe condition and the value of input variables any number of output actions may be takenand alternative course of actions may be taken.<s> An example that we will see in this slideis for an insulin meter that is reading the sugar level and the UI for this.<p>

If the sugar level is falling then there is a certain action to be taken.<s> The R2 and the R1here refer to the two previous readings of the sugar level in this particular case and thecurrent reading is R0.<s> Depending on what the previous three readings were, it is going totake any number of different actions either change the dosage of insulin that is going tobe released or it may just keep it same or keep it constant.<s> This is an example of a tabularspecification.<s> Graphical models like we discussed are primarily UML derivatives andthese are essentially use cases which are supplemented with the help of messagesequence charts.<s> The use cases essentially details use case for every single scenario that ispossible with the user of the system.<s> So for example if you  are modeling an ATMmachine from which one could extract money or do financial transactions with the bank,then one of the use cases may be that the card is validated upon insertion.<s> So what exactlyhappens within this  process is the sequence of actions  that  go on and the  sequence ofactions can be then depicted by the means of a diagram that we are going to see down onthis sheet.<s> The diagram basically outlines basically four different actors in the ATM cardreader.<s> (Refer Slide Time: 51:59)<p>
