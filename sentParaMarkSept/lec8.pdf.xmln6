Business Process is essentially something that outlines the series of actions that may betaken on a relating to a particular business operation.<s> For example,  processing  an  orderwithin a company, that is manufacturing any kind of device.<s> The customer order comes inand there has to be a business process that is associated with.<s> Processing that order beforethe equipment or whatever has been ordered is going get  shipped  out to the customer.Those are called process models.<s> We  will take a more detailed look at example of aprocess model which is an equipment procurement process and see how that flows.<s> Alongwith the process model, there exist dataflow models or DFT diagrams that can show offthe flow.<s> Here the focus is not so much on the movement of the control or the movementof  the action,  but the focus here is on how the data moves and  how the data istransformed as it moves along the process from one process to another.<p>

Let us take a look at these two models.<s> We are going to try and write out example of anequipment procurement process as in this case.<s> This is an example of a business processthat occurs commonly in most say equipment manufacturing companies.<s> There can existfirst of all a couple of databases this need to operate off  of.<s> There can be database ofsuppliers  and there can also be database which lists the type of an  equipment  that ismanufactured by the company.<s> And a business process goes something like this; the firstthing is we specify the kind of equipment that is required.<s> And  then the first step thatoften occurs in this is we may need to validate the specification.<s> This may be done bysome kind of an analyst etc.<p>
