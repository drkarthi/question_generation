Of course the source code is an important deliverable and a deliverable which is inexecutable form.<s> Unlike other deliverables which are documents,  this is a deliverablewhich actually would be loaded on the computer and will be executed which actuallydefines the software contents.<s> And then we will also have different types of manuals ordocuments which will be important for users and for administration of the software, forinstallation of the software and so on.<p>

So these  different types of deliverables are identified from different stages or differentsteps in the waterfall model.<s> At the end of each step, if you recall we had said that everystep ends in a validation and verification step.<s> Similarly in the waterfall model when wemove from one step to another there would be such reviews.<s> Each step would end in areview.<s> These review reports are very important inputs for identifying whether thedevelopment proceeded as per the plans, whatever the short comings whether the defectswill were detected and were properly addressed.<p>

So review report is basically a catalog of how the development went through and it is animportant input to the development team as well as to the management.<s> So these aredifferent deliverables.<s> Many of them are important of which SRS is obviously one of thebaseline.<s> Design document is also very important for future maintenance.<s> Source codedefinitely is important as it is executable and without this user manual, installationmanual,  some administration manuals  and  the system cannot be effectively used.<s> So asyou see here these different documents are essential part of the software.<s> So software isnot just the source code but all this documents which accompany software.<s> Now as we gothrough this waterfall model and we perform the different steps, naturally we areinvesting more effort.<s> The diagram shows the cost effort distribution as we run throughthe different steps in the waterfall model.<s> So there are different steps are shown here.<p>
