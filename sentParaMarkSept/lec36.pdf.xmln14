Then  we introduced  concepts like risk management.<s> Then  we have  integrated projectmanagement.<s> This  particular concept is,  in case you have software  development andcommunications and you have other particular areas then integrated project managementbecomes very important.<s> Organizational process focus: you should strive all the time andsay do not do something unless we have defined a particular process.<s> Therefore focus isthe background music, process, process, process, write it down and do it according to it.Once  you got the focus the  definition is the particular part and then we got the processdefined you need to train the people in using that particular process.<p>

Remember, there is lot of difference between writing it down and people using it the wayit is intended to be used.<s> Decision analysis and resolution in terms of any conflict becauseat each of these particular levels we are going to have plenty of conflicts and how do youresolve this particular thing.<s> You need to have a formal way in which the data is analyzedand then the decisions are taken so database  decision making  will be at this  particularlevel.<s> When we go from level 3 to level 4 you suddenly find in terms that the number ofprocess areas is very few.<p>

If  you look at the slide again we have  only two;  quantitative project management.<s> Wehave  already seen this particular aspect.<s> What  we mean by this is, our data shows thatwhat is the recorded data not for one instance but over a prolonged  period  of time andthen how this particular data is being used for doing the management.<s> Then we have theorganizational  process  performance.<s> You  need to worry whether the processes areperforming  as  planned and  unless the processes perform as planned it is  meaninglessbecause you may say one thing but it may not achieve the kind of levels that you want.<p>
