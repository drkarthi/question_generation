Hello and welcome back to the course on software engineering.<s> Today we are going to betalking about  a subject that has been receiving  increasing  attention  of late of softwarereuse.<s> If you take a look at the traditional engineering methodologies for building otherkinds of systems  for example hardware,  for building civil engineering,  construction,mechanical etc you will find that a lot of work that has been is going to be done to build anew system component, artifact,  entity whatever  borrows  a  lot of the ideas  the designideas,  borrows a lot of..  even prebuilt components  from other  from previously  donework but in software because it is a relatively new field that practice of reusing softwarewhat goes into making the software in the software itself is not very well established andwe will try to take a look at some of the notions in the field of software reuse; now whatis reuse, what are the problems of reuse, what are the advantages of reuse, what are thedifferent ways of what can be reused, what are the different ways of doing it is themain objective of this lecture.<p>

So,  design with reuse is a  frame  phrase that is often used and there are  actually twophrases that are complimentary phrases to one another designed with reuse and designedfor reuse.<s> Designed  with reuse essentially focuses on building software from reusablecomponents.<s> So,  instead of trying to write software from scratch what I will do is takecomponents that have code built into them that embeds certain algorithms  within themthat I know that I also want in this new project that I am trying to put together and I willsimply reuse these components.<p>

On the other hand, design for reuse is essentially the reverse mechanism.<s> So when I amdesigning a component that I am going to use in my project I consciously make an effortto design it in a more generic in a more abstract manner  so that it can be reused  acrossmultiple projects.<s> So, in one view the software project that is currently being undertakenis a sink for component and it is a sink as far as the reuse process is concerned; the othercase it is the source as for as the reuse process is concerned.<p>
