So, agreeing upon the scope changes and managing the actual changes when they occur;managing is very important.<s> We have always had this  problem that a change wasincorporated but somebody overrode that particular change and an old version of the filewas again retrieved, recovered or incorporated in the build sequence of a product and thechange which you apparently made does not reflect in the final product.<p>

Now, remember this; the scope change control that we are talking about also needs to beintegrated with the other change control processes.<s> In the integrated  integrationknowledge area that is last we have we have a process called overall change control.<s> Theoverall change control integrates between changes for it.<s> Take a simple example; supposeI was to change the scope of my project it may affect the changes to quality, it may affectchanges to cost, it may affect changes to schedule and so on and so forth so you cannotmake a change to the scope without making corresponding changes also  to otherknowledge areas.<s> So,  scope change control process acts by itself and it also integrateswith the other change control processes  in the organization other change controlprocesses in the organization.<p>

Now, before.. this being a very important point before we go further let me highlightsome suggestions which are made by experts to minimize the changes to the projectscope.<s> Please remember,  though the changes are not avoidable  they can definitely beminimized.<p>

So, what are the stages?First, develop a good project selection process develop a good project selection process.Include the users in almost all decision making.<s> Co-locate the users with the developersso that the familiarity between the two will avoid misunderstanding, use techniques likeprototyping,  joint application development or  if you are a  rational rows user  use cases,kind of  approaches to clearly understand the requirements.<s> The more you invest inunderstanding the requirements there are less chances of there being changes to the scopelater on.<s> So  these stakeholders  and various stakeholders and the developers if  they arebrought close to each other then the chances of any changes due to misunderstanding arelikely to be.<p>
