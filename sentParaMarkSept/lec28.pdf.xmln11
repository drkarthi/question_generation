So,  if you are just giving a  bunch of interfaces with no notion  as to what the expectedbehavior  of  these  interfaces  are  that  is not a complete specification.<s> Remember,  in  thelecture on specific formal specification we took a look at what were called abstract datatypes and abstract data types contain sections of behavioral specification within it whichcame in the form of axiomatic specifications.<s> You specified a list of axioms that said thatthe method interfaces that I am providing in this component or data type have certainrules that they will follow and here are  the rules in the form of axiomatic specification.So, if something like that exists it will give the appropriate mental model in terms of howdoes this component behave when I use it; it is not merely the interfaces.<p>

Also, look at visual representations from modeling the states of object choose models thatcan be drawn visually so UMS  state models,  for example,  can be  used  in this case.Writing formal specifications is a  very good idea;  it both gives the user the confidencethat this component has been well thought of and it is going to behave robustly, also, itgives them a very good idea of how this component is going to.. what is the behaviorexpected behavior if I use this particular interface of the component and so on.<s> (Refer Slide Time: 43:33 min)<p>
