Let us now go to the second subprocess in scope management that is the scope planningand definition process.<s> Scope planning and definition process is aimed at note thatprogressively elaborating  not one time progressively elaborating and of coursedocumenting  the work that needs to be done to produce the product.<s> So  it  developsdocuments which will form  the basis for all the subsequent project decisions all thesubsequent project decisions.<s> So criteria for completion of a project or the  phase of aproject what are the estimated costs, what are the schedules, what are the resources, whatis the baseline for monitoring and controlling the projects,  what measurements arerequired,  how  they are to be done,  what information needs to be communicated up anddown the organization  and clarity in assigning roles and responsibilities to differentpeople who are associated with the project  and last but not the least  evolve a commonunderstanding for the projects scope amongst all the stakeholders.<p>

So  the scope planning and definition process really is at the heart of the project scopemanagement activity.<s> It  will result in some kind of a work breakdown structure beingproduced.<s> Understand,  we will talk now  of a  lot of breakdown structures.<s> The workbreakdown structure will tell you what different activities need to be performed  tocomplete the project.<s> Similarly later on we will talk of deliverable breakdown structure; itwill say what things will be physically delivered to either the internal or external clientsof the project.<p>

So  first let  us look at the typical work breakdown structure.<s> So,  look at this particularslide.<p>

We have  an internet project and  at level one we need to do say  five activities;conceptualize the project, do a website design, then develop the website according to thedesign, then do a role out and provide an ongoing support for our site.<s> Now each of theseparticular tasks each of these tasks at the first level can be further defined at the secondlevel.<s> So look at the concepts part of it.<s> So first we will do is evaluate the current systemthen define the requirements for our particular project, then define the risk managementapproach  for  our project, then we develop a project plan for performing the project andwe do a briefing for the development team.<p>
