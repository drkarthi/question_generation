Lot of record  keeping  has to be done.<s> It is  important that we use appropriate tools andalso build different types of models through which our understanding can be conciselystated and can be verified with the users.<s> So these are the different phases we havediscussed last time.<s> Let us continue further and see what is available further inrequirement analysis phase and what kind of documentation standards are prescribed forrecording the findings during the analysis phase.<s> Structured analysis has often beenaccepted as one of the common technique to use during requirement analysis.<s> It consistsof focusing on various functions and processes existing in the user environment and thenidentifying the data flowing between these functions.<p>

We generally use the top down decomposition approach in this, where initially the wholeapplication is seen as a single process.<s> For this process we identify  the different inputs,outputs, who are the users of the system, what kind of data is stored and which needs tobe used, which data needs to be made available to the application.<s> So at the single processview of the application, the external interfaces in terms of the inputs, outputs, users andpossible data sources are identified.<s> This is the initial step or the first step.<s> Here after wedecompose this process into sub processes.<s> And we identify the different data which flowbetween them.<p>

The two techniques which we commonly used  in the structure analysis method arefunction decomposition technique and the data flow diagrams.<s> We will study them inmore details subsequently.<s> But basically the idea here in the functional decomposition isthat the overall functionality of the software system we planned to develop is brokendown into sub tasks.<s> For example, in a railway reservation system we may have one subfunction called reservation, the next one called cancellation, the third which may consistof producing various types of reports, and the fourth could be maintaining the data aboutvarious trains and schedules,  and time tables and so on.<s> So we decompose the overallfunctionality into sub tasks or sub processes.<s> This is the function decomposition.Once the function decomposition has been done and the sub processes have beenidentified,  we  also can establish what kind of data flow takes place among these subprocesses.<s> So this is the methodology in the case of structured techniques.<s> Andsubsequent to doing this kind of analysis, where we start from a single process view anddecompose it, we proceed further to establish what is called the current physical dataflow diagram.<p>
