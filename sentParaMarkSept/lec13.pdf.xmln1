Welcome back.<s> Today we are going to talk about software quality and  this is verydifferent from what we have  already  discussed in this course as part of qualitymanagement process of producing software.<s> There are two things we should consider, theprocess and the product.<s> Quality measurements,  quality monitoring and qualityimprovement can be applied to both of these.<s> For example,  you can make processimprovements,  CMM metrics suite  which  exists that  actually  covers, how  you  measurethe process efficiencies, how you improve process efficiencies and so on.<s> There is also anaspect to be considered in terms of producing quality software.<s> That aspect is that of thequality of software itself inherent to the design techniques  that we use  and  the  kind ofabstraction that we use for  building  the  software.<s> This is going to  be focus of todaysdiscussion.<p>

All of this is motivated by taking a perspective on the changes that have happened insoftware and also the statistics about software development project themselves over thelast twenty to thirty years.<s> If you take a look at this graph or this chart, what it is basicallytrying to show is that,  even though lot of things have changed about computers andsoftware, there are some characteristics of software projects that have remained constant.Basically, 35 or 40 years ago, software projects are to be constantly late.<s> They were neverdelivered  on time or never under budget or on budget.<s> They were always over budget.They were very buggy in the sense that they had a lot of correctness issue with thesoftware itself.<s> They were very inflexible when we want to make a small change to thesoftware.<s> Inflexible in the sense it would cost a lot of money, it would cost lot of time, lotof effort, lot of people who are involved in making a change in the existing product.<s> Thischaracteristic of software has not changed even  when this survey was done during theyear 2000.<s> Essentially when they did this survey of software projects in the late eighties,they came up with a term called software crisis.<s> The software crisis was basically meantto illustrate the fact that the average software project was late by an average of almost 30months, which was quite long.<p>
