So one can see here that SRS format has taken into account various aspects and we cansee that by using this specification format, we are meeting our expectation that thedocument will clearly tell the user what features and functions the software will provideand how he will be able to use it.<s> Similarly we have made it detailed enough, so that fromhere we can hand over this document to our design team.<s> And they will be able to convertthe specifications into a design.<s> So SRS document which is a baseline document needs tobe detailed and we must ensure that we have collected all these data and put it in the formof a document.<p>

Once the SRS is prepared, which can be an extensive task for large software, we need toreview this with users.<s> There has to be a formal review meeting in which the entire SRSdocument  would  be  reviewed.<s> There should be a sign off,  where the users should saythat; yes, the SRS document clearly defines what the system needs to do.<s> And also therewould be some peer review, which will ensure that the document contains enough detailsfor the design activity to be carried out.<s> So we are going to do the design subsequently.<s> Itmust contain the enough details, so that the design can be carried out.<p>

We can define the platforms, we can define the capacities, and we can work out the sizesrequired for the different systems and so on.<s> All these must be possible from the SRSdocument and we see that it is detailed enough to give us all these data.<s> It is veryimportant that the analysis phase results in preparation of such a detailed and standarddocument.<s> So  we proceed further only when the document is accepted by the users asbeing complete in all aspects.<s> Once it is signed off, we proceed to the next phase, whichis the design phase.<s> In the design phase our objective is to formulate the implementationstrategies for the problem that has been identified.<s> So now we move to the how part ofthe solution.<s> In the SRS  phase  or  in the requirement analysis phase,  we have definedwhat part of the problem.<s> Now we are trying to address  How the problem shouldbe addressed, how it should be solved?<s> Input to this phase is naturally the SRS documentfrom the previous step.<s> We now try to consider different technical alternatives.<p>
