There can be different types of users of the system and the models, for example  theexternal models can be used to communicate with some of the users of the system.<s> Thereare various kinds of bases, actually three bases along which these models can beconstructed and the first base is the external perspective.<s> This is a model that will showhow the system that is being built is likely to interact with other systems of the context inwhich the system is likely to function.<s> An example of the external perspective could bethat you are building an  ERP system  (Enterprise Resource Planning system) for thebusiness, and the ERP system in turn would have to interact with the financials package itwould have to interact with the data source that allows the data to be fed into the systemetc.<s> This is not part of the system functionality per se, but these models serve to illustratehow the system that is going to be built is going to end up interacting with other systemsin its context.<p>

The second types  of models that can be constructed are what are called behavioralmodels.<s> Behavioral models essentially try to show the perspective  or  behavior,  the waythe system is going to react to certain stimuli, the way the system is going to have a statediagram associated with it.<s> It is basically the reaction of the system to external stimuli.<p>

Finally the structural perspective or structural models are essentially concerned withshowing what the different data architectures of the system are likely to  look like.Functional breakup of the systems modules or the modularization of the system itself asfar as what are the different modules that is composed of and how they can be puttogether in order to form the system functionality.<s> The models cover the range of theinside of the system,  as is going to be seen through the eyes of a analyst at the verybeginning of the process all the way through to what are the different textualsurroundings that the system is going to end up interacting with.<s> Amongst the high levelcategories that are considered the structural,  the  behavioral and the contextual or  theexternal perspectives, there are different kinds of models that can be constructed.Data processing models for example or DFT diagrams as they are known popularly show,how the data is put together, what is the structure of the data etc.<s> Data dictionaries alsoform of data processing model.<s> Architectural models on the other hand essentially have todo with the principle subsystems as the system is divided logically.<s> And there can bestimulus response models or state transition diagrams that will show how the systemreacts to different external events and so on and so forth.<s> We will get into each one ofthese models in detail as we go through the presentation.<p>
