We will now start taking a look at some of the techniques that can actually used  to putdown these requirements.<s> So if we take a look at user requirements, they should describeboth functional and non functional requirements in such a way that they are understoodby the system users themselves so it should be expressed in some kind of naturallanguage it can use diagrams it can use tables etc.<s> But it has to be understood by userswithout the detailed technical knowledge of how the system is going to work, but exactlywhat the system is going to do.<s> The problems as soon as they think of natural language,let us say that the requirements are going to be written in English.<s> The first problem thatcomes up is that  there is a certain degree of ambiguity or the lack of clarity aroundnatural language, because precision is difficult to achieve and something is being writtenin English.<s> Which is why English is not a computable language directly.<p>

So there is a lack of clarity and to achieve a certain degree of precision is going to bevery difficult without making the document to  be far too verbose  to read.<s> So therequirements document can run in  to  hundreds of pages because every small functionalrequirement is being specified to a great degree of detail.<s> The other issue that can arise isrequirements confusion.<s> So the level of detail gets missed up.<s> For example, at one level itcan  be conceptual but the same requirement can also be talking of a different level ofdetail which is very fine grain, which is one aspect of it.<s> Functional and non functionalrequirements can tend to get mixed up that is another aspect of it.<p>

So the requirement confusion tends to cover this notion of mixing up different levels ofdetail,  mixing  of different types of specification, different  types of requirements into asingle statement.<s> Finally there is the notion of requirements amalgamation,  which is asituation that tends to combine multiple requirements into a single statement or is beingexpressed together.<s> For example, there can be a notion of trying to introduce security aswell as some kind of costing practice into the same system and we will see some of theexamples of this as we go along.<p>

But these are some problems which arise from natural languages right here is going backto the example of the library system that we were developing earlier here is an exampleof requirement that causes some degree of confusion.<s> This statement I am going to read itout just for your reference.<s> LIBSYS shall provide a financial accounting system thatmaintains records of all payments made by the users of the system.<s> The system managersmay configure this system so that regular users can receive discounted rates.<p>
