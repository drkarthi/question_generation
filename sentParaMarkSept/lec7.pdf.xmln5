Some of the rules that we can start writing down immediately  are,  IS  EMPTY (NEWSTACK)  TRUE  IS EMPTY of a NEW STACK always  have  to return TRUE.Because as soon as the new stack is constructed and nothing has been pushed on to it, ISEMPTY  has always got to be true.<s> That is one of the axioms.<s> And given theprecondition,  if we apply the pop operation to a new stack,  remember we said that theprecondition IS EMPTY is false.<p>

So in the new stack it is always going to be true.<s> As a result of which the POP operationhas to always result in an error in this case.<s> POP (NEW STACK)  ERROR These aretwo axioms.<s> The third axiom is that the same thing can apply to top as well.<s> The top of anew stack is going to also result in an error.<s> TOP(NEW STACK)  ERROR Finally wecan we can write out one rule that basically says that when you create a new stack, andthen you push an element G onto the new stack,  and you take that top of the stack,  italways necessarily has to return G. TOP(PUSH(NEW STACK,G))  G What this rule istrying to say is that, when you push an element on to a stack that is empty, there is goingto be only one element on the stack and nothing else can exist.<p>
