Now, having this data in the member table itself would be very efficient because we will nothave to count the books in issue file or  we will have  we will not have to count how manybooks he has claimed in the claim file;  these can be directly obtained by accessing themembers data in the member file or the member table.<s> So keeping these summary data foreach member is going to make our issue transaction very efficient.<s> So we introduce thissummary data.<s> But we must also remember that this summary data now needs to be updatedevery time we do issue or claim type of transaction so we may then decide to split the tableinto two tables called member one and member two.<p>

Member  one we will typically content the aggregate data or the summary data and themember two file will contain data which is not changing.<s> So,  both of these tables can beindexed on the members id.<s> This is how you do physical database design.<s> You  look at thetable, you look at the different operations which are performed on this and in order to makethose operations efficient you may introduce additional fields or you may split the file so thatbased on the different types of data access you may split that two different tables.<p>

Now  we have given here design for other tables.<s> For  example,  for the books file we willintroduce a summary field called number of claims.<s> In the claims table which had one recordfor every book claimed we may do factoring of data so that for a given book an array is keptwhich indicates all the claims for that book.<s> So this particular record will have an arrayindicating the users id and the date on which the claim was put for this book by differentmembers.<s> So this is going to be efficient, all the data will be available in a single record.<p>
