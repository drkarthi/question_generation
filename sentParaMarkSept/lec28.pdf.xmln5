The second situation it may be far worse is that it may have ten of the twelve features thatyou want  but the two other features are not there so you do  not  have control over theamount or the functionality that you are getting in here because it is a system you have topick the system as a whole you cannot pick and choose the features of the system;  thesame thing with  performance.<s> Unless it needs the performance needs which it may forsome function or may not for some function then again it requires a lot of customization,lot of extension and a lot of recoding in order to get this thing to work right.<p>

Certainly there could be problems in probability; the same problem must be solved withframework but here intrabobability becomes much more key because it is likely there aremultiple applications working in a single scenario.<s> In  the case of frameworks it may  bethat  the framework underlies all the applications and so entrapolbility  may not be thatbigger deal.<s> So  they are really conformant with standards, well-known standards, well-established standards it may be really difficult to integrate these things.<s> But thedevelopment of technology such as web services and so on has made us has allowed us tobasically  wrapper  some of these applications with standard interfaces so that they arenow able to talk to one another.<p>

The same problem with system evolution as you would see with component based reuseand with frameworks is that every time your  system needs to  evolve the COTS systemshould be capable of scaling up and evolving in the same way of sense otherwise thiscould become a real problem and the support always is going to  come from vendors soyou are not controlling your own destiny in this case  and you have to be careful whenyou are reusing entire systems that the vendor is going to be around in the next five yearsfor example when your system is going to be around and if they go out of business andthere is nobody to support you then how are  you going to manage the maintenance andevolution of your system is a situation that you have to keep under control.<p>
