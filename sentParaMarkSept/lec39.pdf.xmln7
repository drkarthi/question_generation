Documentation  filing  is a very important activity though it seems to be like taken forgranted.<s> The  need for good documentation need  not be over stressed,  software must beextensible,  reusable,  and maintainable,  it cannot be done unless you have gooddocumentation and this documentation is collected properly and maintained properly andmodified properly.<s> You are not going to get the job done.<p>

This  documentation  may be used either within the organization or outside theorganization.<s> For instance, the user manual is being used by the users.<s> So document filingissues are like; what are the inputs, the deliverables, the work products, the standards andother documents like plans, exemptions, guidelines and record of data, reviewing of therecords, test record etc, so how do you store them, how do you access control them andwho authorizes whom to use this particular data.<s> Therefore the last part of the projectcommunication  that  is the project documentation is concerned  with everybody in theproject.<p>

Now we come to the next process procurement.<s> For a variety of reasons an organizationmay not like to get the entire  job done by resources within the organization but theyprefer to procure resources, outsource resources from somewhere else.<s> Procurementmeans acquiring goods and services from an outside organization.<p>

Therefore an organization outsource products and services for a variety of reasons like itmay reduce fixed and a recurring cost, the  vendor  takes the benefit of volumes and thescales.<s> There  are  many illustrations  that  can be given.<s> For  instance,  somebody who iscontracting with Kodak for photographs may contract for a million photographs and sellin turns at a discounted price to various people at a price below the retail price at whichthe Kodak sells the photograph.<s> Similarly, you might get benefited by reducing the fixedand the recurring cost because that is the only job that the vendor does.<p>
