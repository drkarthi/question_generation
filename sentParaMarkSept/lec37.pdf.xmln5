Then you have problems like some of them are software components but there are lots ofnon software components which also need to be put under configuration control.<s> Thesecould be physical documents like contract and so on and so forth.<s> Those  particulardocuments will also be a part of the CI library but probably it may sit in a cupboard.<s> Wehave lots of other things.<p>
