There can be multiple events that transition it from one state to another and do not haveto be a single event.<s> In this case from running to waiting we have said  that an eventdone which is when it completes timer runs out it is going to wait.<s> It can also be that theuser cancels the operation or stops the microwave in the middle.<s> For example you set itup to heat for a minute and thirty seconds later you decide that you think it is enough andtherefore you cancel the operation.<s> So there  can be external events multiple externalevents that cause a state change and that can also be illustrated in this case.<s> We said thatthis can often be supplemented with the help of tables that give a descriptive idea of whatthe state transition diagram is going to look like.<s> Here is an example of a table that showsthe state description for a microwave in this case.<p>

We did have an  enabled  and a disabled state and we have two different states calledwaiting on full power and waiting on half power.<s> For example we said setting the powerlevel can be done in multiple ways and if you set to full power it goes on waiting to fullpower.<s> If  it is set to half power it is going to cook on half power or  it is going to  bewaiting on half power.<s> The rest of the states are pretty much what we talked about earlier.We can also describe all the stimuli and in this diagram basically describe the states thatexisted and there is a description of each of the states.<p>

Here we are describing the events that cause state transition.<s> For example half power isan event that illustrates that the user has set the microwave to run on half power and thetimer set for example is an event that illustrates that the user has set the timer for thirtyseconds or a minute or whatever.<p>
