Can I show the same thing using two binary relationships; one between part and projectand the other between part and supplier as has been done in the diagram B?<s> In fact, toverify this,  you again should try to walk through the diagram.<s> Let me take one project.From this project, I can go by this relationship and I will find out all the parts which havebeen supplied or which have been received for this project.<s> So I can go to part say P1 byP2  by  P3.<s> Once I have reached P1  by  P2  by  P3, I naturally forget from where I havecome, because I am only at the part instance.<s> If I take up P1 and follow through, I canfind out who are the suppliers, all the suppliers who have supplied this part P1.<s> Butbecause I have broken it into two parts, I cannot say this is the supplier who had suppliedfor the given project.<s> If I start from that supplier I may go to many project parts.<s> I takeone part and I come here and I reach many projects.<s> In general I will not be able to nowtie down which part was supplied in what quantity for which project.<p>

If we are talking about the same real world which was shown earlier as a ternary and nowit has been shown as two binary, then it is not the same.<s> One of these has to be incorrect.If the ternary relationship is the correct one, then replacing it by two binary is a modelingerror and it  is not the same.<s> This is the case even when  you add additional binaryrelationship between project and supplier,  it will not capture the main point that we aremaking.<s> The question, what was supplied, in what quantity, in which project and bywhich supplier is properly answered by the model that we used a ternary relationship.<s> Butit is not properly handled by the two binaries.<p>
