Besides keeping all this data and helping the owner to advertise and paying commissionto the sales people and also helping sales people to find out what kind of price negotiationthey  should do,  we also need to prepare some regular reports for the owner of the carmart so that he can get a good idea of what kind of profits he is making,  what kind ofpayments he has to meet etc.<s> All these details are important part of application.<s> We haveto prepare a data flow diagram and an ER diagram for this.<s> When you are developing theapplication like this, after you have done the analysis and you have understood what ishappening in the users application domain,  you understand the processing,  youunderstand the data,  and you  would now convert these  understanding into the models.And you will prepare a suitable data flow diagram and a suitable ER diagram.<p>

We always should keep in mind that these two diagrams are really complementing eachother.<s> ER diagrams show the data which is there in the application.<s> It identifies this datain terms of entities and relationships.<s> The same data that we see in an ER diagram shouldalso naturally be seen in the data flow diagram in some form.<s> Data flow diagramsactually indicate the data stores.<s> What we store in the data stores in a data flow diagram isthe information domain or the data domain of the application and that is what should bemodeled in the ER diagram.<s> So the two models should be compatible in terms of data thatthey show and this is the important part that we need to address as we prepare these twodiagrams.<s> Generally you would do them sequentially but you will also cross check eachof them with the other.<s> Let us look at the data flow diagram for the car mart.<s> Ideally weshould have started with the context diagram.<p>
