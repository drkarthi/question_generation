The complier  tells you whether  passing data are wrong type so that somebody else isgoing to manipulate it wrongly.<s> So that cannot happen and it is okay to do this.<s> And lastlythe data coupling which we have went through already.<s> Just like we had strong or weakcoupling to be a desirable characteristic,  we have a strong cohesion to be a desirablecharacteristic.<s> There are six  classical levels  of cohesion that we can see.<s> One is calledcoincidental cohesion which is driven by stylistic concerns.<s> An example here isprint_prompt_and_check_parameters.<p>

This is a shell function.<s> This is trying to do two different things.<s> Printing the prompt andchecking the parameters that have been given to it.<s> But they are trying to put these twotogether and that may or may not make sense.<s> It typically does  not make sense to dothings like this which is why it is the first one.<s> This list is in the increasing degree ofstrength and you want as a high degree of cohesion as you possibly can get.<s> The secondone is logical.<s> It is related logic but no corresponding relation in control or data.<s> Againsomething we do  not want.<s> Library of functions those are  completely unrelated to oneanother.<s> But they may be in a library but  they all are math functions or something likethat which you do not want again.<p>

Temporal  is the next characteristic.<s> It is  series of actions  that are related in timeInitialization is a good example of this.<s> There are four other levels of cohesion and whatwe really want is the final level of cohesion which is called data cohesion.<s> Data cohesionrefers to the fact that its central item around which the module is being constructed is apiece of data and then all the things that are surrounding the piece of data manipulate thatdata in some way.<s> It is  a set of operations  that are related to a single piece of data.Objects and classes in object oriented design help us do that.<s> Typically what we want is alow degree of coupling between modules and a high degree of cohesion within a module.<p>
