When you start counting the function point we have users and you have a system and thesystem has a boundary and the users do three types of transactions; the inputs, the outputsand the enquiries.<s> People  often have difficulty in what you call distinguishing betweenthe outputs and the enquiries.<s> We can only explain to them on a little lighter side.<s> Someof the things that come to your mind is that the output is some kind of a batch mode andenquiries is something online.<s> Both these particular notions are farthest from the truth.<p>

You can have an online output and you can have a batch output similarly you can haveonline enquiry and you can have a batch enquiry.<s> So how do we distinguish between thetwo and there is one particular way of separating it.<s> If you are physically retrieving thedata that is stored inside the system then usually we call it as  the enquiry.<s> It  is likelooking up in just saying an answer like there is a simple example; when you say, can yougive me the list of all the people who have not paid their bills for the last three months, itwould be an enquiry, it  does  not  involve any computational effort.<s> But if I was to askyour another particular question;  can you tell me how much is the total outstandingattributed to  people who have  not paid for three years, three months or something likethat then this involves doing a computation and then this would be in a simplistic senseclassified  as  the output.<s> There are  more elaborate explanations  as to what  the output isand what the enquiry is.<s> These are the transaction function types.<s> Then we have a simplequestion.<p>
