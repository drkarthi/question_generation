Structure chart also shows important data.<s> As we  just now saw these data are shown asflowing between the different modules.<s> There may be either data coming into the moduleor the data going out from the module to the calling module.<s> Usually you do not show thecontrol flow in the structure chart.<s> However some important control flow or structuressuch as decision making  and  iterations  may  also be shown on a structure chart withoutgiving too many details.<s> In fact this is only to indicate to the reader of the structure chart,that some modules may be repeatedly executed, whereas some modules may be executedonly  depending  on certain condition.<s> The few notational extensions are made to thestructure chart as shown in the diagram.<p>

Here the diagram at the top shows iteration.<s> It shows that module A may be repeatedlycall on modules C and D.  The diagram at the bottom has a small diamond here whichindicates that module A will call module C or D depending on some condition.<s> In fact thedetails of the condition are details of how often the iteration would be done are not givenon the structure chart.<s> It only shows that such an iteration or decision making is present inthe software.<s> And these are the important repetitions or iterations and the importantdecisions which are made in the software functions.<p>

On the object oriented approach the software consists of different classes.<s> In fact class isthe main concept in the object oriented approach,  where it has both the data associatedwith the class and the executable functions associated with the class.<s> So we call these asstructure and behavior for a class.<s> This is a paradigm which combines the data and theprocessing to get them on a single dimension and identifies classes which have structuralproperties and which has a  behavior  or methods defined for them.<s> It is  a completelydifferent paradigm and we will see more details of this subsequently.<p>
