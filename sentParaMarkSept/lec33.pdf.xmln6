What are the limitations of function point approach?The  biggest limitation is that  it does not provide time estimate.<s> Like incase you arerequired to tell the management  how long will it take for you to  develop this particularsystem you have to take recourse to some other method and the FPA method will not tellyou how long this particular software development project will take to develop.<s> Next is itdoes not give you any phase-wise break up, it only tells you the total development effortis so much, it does not tell you how much is per analysis, how much is for design, howmuch is for coding, testing etc.<s> Therefore you cannot really plan your resources based onthis particular estimate.<p>

Another limitation is that this function point approach cannot be used for estimating thedevelopment of system software.<s> It is only useful for application software.<s> If you have todevelop system software or utilities or some such particular kind of a thing then the FPAapproach is not good for that.<p>

Accumulated  data for productivity is obviously required in all methods but also in thisparticular method.<s> Therefore unless you have good productivity you are required to stickto certain industry norms of the kind that we mentioned.<s> And last but not the least it is avery major weakness for function point.<s> It is assumed that there is no change to softwaredevelopment productivity with the size of the project and it is documented enoughnumber of times and in enough number of authors, enough places and as the size of theproject increases the development productivity dramatically drops.<s> Starting from that letus now go to the next estimation technique of COCOMO or Constructive Cost Module.COCOMO was original propose by Barry Boehm in 1981, he has also probably publishedanother book called COCOMO II.<p>

The COCOMO II  definitely involves use of some kind of software tools for makingestimates.<s> COCOMO is one of the best documented method in public domain.<s> It covers abroad spectrum of software development projects  starting from small software to largesoftware and from new development to modification enhancements etc.<p>
