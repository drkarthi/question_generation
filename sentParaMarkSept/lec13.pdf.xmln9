What is important in considering all of these definitions is that we have to some howrelate them back to the notion of software quality.<s> Remember the factors that affect thequality that we went through.<s> There were factors such as extensibility, there were factorssuch as reusability, and there were factors such as maintainability, understandability andso on.<s> We have to be able to relate all of these back to the definition and that is when itbecomes important.<s> The definition of the abstraction is the notion of distinguishing theessence from the detail What exactly does this mean?<s> This means that what is importantabout it is not the representation or how it is constructed.<s> But what can it do for us is whatwe would like to take a look at first.<s> That is called the separation of interface from theimplementation.<p>

There can be different or multiple  representations  for a particular interface for someobject and  those different implementations become possible when you separate them toreplace one implementation with another.<s> If this level of abstraction does  not exist,  itbecomes very difficult to  change something into software.<s> If the interface and theimplementation were inter-connectedly mixed then the clients of that particular modulewould have to be changed if the module gets changed as well.<p>
