So for example, if the system has to fit on a disk which has less than 10 Giga byte of diskspace or it has to run on a system that is less than 128 megabytes of memory.<s> Those arespace requirements.<s> Performance requirements on the other hand really have to do with,how fast the system executes.<s> Organizational requirements can be classified further intodelivery requirements in the sense, how the system package is going to be.<s> Whether in aCD or is it going to be downloadable software, is it going to come on a tape of some kindetc.<s> There can be licensing requirements attached to it.<s> Implementation requirements suchas particular standard process have  to be used during the implementation and so on.External requirements are classified typically into interoperability requirements; you haveto be able to interoperate with the other external vendors.<p>

For example, if I am buying a system from Oracle to do a financial accounting and wecan put in a constraint saying that I have an SAP or ERP system and I have to be able toput data into this as well as extract data out of the SAP system and be able to interoperatewith this particular system.<s> Then there can be legislative requirements with the adventand the explosion of web based systems, privacy concerns have taken up very importantrole.<s> So there can be privacy requirement,  for example the data that is provided to thesystem shall not be shared or shall not be accessible by any other persons.<s> There can besecurity requirements, safety requirements and so on.<s> Those are external to the system inthe development process by which the system is made by itself.<p>
