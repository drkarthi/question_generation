If we can somehow achieve that continuity by keeping a common language across thisprocess,  that there is successive refinement going on all the way from requirementspecification,  analysis,  design,  implementation and then testing then we can ensure thatthere  is traceability in this process.<s> Testing should be really taking code and taking therequirements as an input and then with the help of a machine verification technique weshould be able to  match the requirements to the code and ensure that the code indeedmeets the requirements that have been written out.<p>

If we can achieve that we would have gone a long way towards improving the quality ofsoftware that gets constructed.<s> We saw the  3  keys to achieving structural quality wasreuse, abstraction at various levels and continuity within the process.<s> Coming back to theabstraction,  how do we define abstraction?<s> What  are the different levels  of abstractionthat we have talked about etc?<p>

The abstraction is basically the process of separating out the properties that is inherent insome body from the body itself.<s> An  example of this could be that every vehicle ischaracterized by certain property and that is an example which is given out here.<s> Everyvehicle is characterized by certain property.<s> The properties of a  vehicle are it has anengine and it can move you from one place to another.<s> It is not necessary that it is goingto have wheels because not all vehicles have wheels.<s> Land vehicles have wheels on themand that is another feature that we want to look at.If we take a look at land vehicles,  then we can say that land vehicles have wheels inaddition to an engine and they have some means of steering etc.<s> What we are trying to doin this process is to take a look at a specific object and in this case let us say we took alook at a car.<s> We are trying to generalize some properties from this specific object  andthen apply it to all objects of that kind.<s> No matter whether you are talking about Maruthicar or whether you are talking about Hyundai car you will notice that it is going to havean engine, it is going to have four  wheels  and  it going to have four doors etc.<s> Someproperties could be relevant only to the specific instance, for example, a two door car ispossible and some properties can be fixed, for example, four wheels on a car is typicallyfixed.<s> No matter which make of car it is.<p>

The process of abstraction is the process of more human like reasoning.<s> It is a process ofgeneralization  from specificities.<s> In that process what you are doing is,  you are takingcertain essential characteristics  and you are taking them away from your particularinstance of the whale that you saw, particular instance of the car that you saw Then youare creating this abstract representation saying, I am going to stay away from this car, butI know what all cars are now characterized by.<s> In other words, it can also be thought of asdistinguishing essence from detail.<p>
