This is the definition of the operation of replace item.<s> However what we see is that  theoperation replace item is the one that is entirely composed of operations that have alreadybeen defined.<s> IS EMPTY already exists within the stack definition that we gave.<s> PUSHexists within the stack definition that we gave.<s> POP  also exists within the stackdefinitions we gave.<s> Operations such as POP, PUSH and IS EMPTY can be considered tobe what are called atomic operations.<p>

In that they cannot be broken down further and they express in terms of other operationsof the stack whereas operations such as Replace Item, there can be any number of theseoperations that we can come up with are what are called non atomic or compoundoperations.<s> Replace Item  would be compound in nature whereas the other  three    ISEMPTY, POP and PUSH would be atomic in nature.<p>

Coming back to the notion of completeness of a specification,  what we have to reallythink about is, mathematically if the axioms that have been laid out can be used to proveany expression that can be constructed out of the language of the theory then it is acomplete specification.<s> That is the definition of mathematical completeness and what thisreally means to say is that, given all the axioms and the operations, if i can combine thesePUSHes and POPs, IS EMPTYs, NEWs and the TOPs in any particular order as long as ithas to satisfy two criteria, first it syntactically it has to be a well formed operation.<s> Andsecondly,  semantically  it has to be correct.<s> What do we mean by that is syntactically,there are certain rules that we have laid out when we have defined the operationsthemselves.<s> For example PUSH always puts two arguments which are a stack of type Gand an element of type G. So a PUSH or just an element of type G is not a valid operationor is not a well formed expression in other words.<p>
