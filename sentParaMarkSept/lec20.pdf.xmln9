This multiple exit form is allowed by programming languages.<s> So it is not considered as amajor violation of programming.<s> This gives you the another aspect of full fledged Gotowhich may be desirable from readability point of view or say from avoiding temporaryvariable point of view.<s> Now we had seen exceptions as one aspect of multiple exit formor one aspect of Goto restricted to its exit criteria and another one is return.<s> Now wehave some other modern multiple exit forms which we will look at with some examplesand after that probably we will end this lecture.<s> Unconditional break: That means you canbreak into an outer loop.<p>

For example, you have two loops or you have a single loop and  you can simply breakfrom that loop into the outer scope.<s> Or if you have two loops and you can break the innerloop and break into outer loop.<s> Unconditional continue: Continues with next iteration ofthe current loop.<s> If you have for statement and you might want to check for a specificcondition inside the for  loop and based on the condition you may want to continuedirectly to the next iteration or you may want to execute some business logic for thatparticular iteration,  you can use unconditional continue form.<s> All these forms areavailable in java and this is just an example from the java domain or the java constructs.Then you have labeled break,  where you can break the outer enclosing loop.<s> You canuse labels and then break the outer closing loop using the label break.<p>

You have label continue, where you can continue the next iteration of the outer loop.<s> Sothese are very interesting multiple exit forms and you have to use them effectively and asper the requirement.<s> You have to choose exactly which one is required for your program,for your code.<s> Basically, which exit form is required or which break or continue form isrequired for your code, such that, the code becomes easy to understand and probably alsoeasy to write.<s> This is an example of unlabeled break.<s> You have this array of integers andyou  want to search for 12.<s> So you have  this  for  loop:  for I is equal to  0;  I less thanlength of array; I plus plus<p>
