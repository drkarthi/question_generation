Now from our particular point of view we will look at it and say that how does this helpus in completing the job.<s> We did three things.<s> To begin with early in the game we usedFPA technique and made an over all effort estimation for the system.<s> Then we got the joband then we did  some kind of a broad estimate,  some broad higher level design andestimated the number of lines of code for the system and then used  the COCOMOmethod and went to management with a plan to indicate how much resource of what typewill be required approximately when.<s> Then when we got the resource  we  only  talkedabout  the program development effort then we were able to say that  we have so muchtime  availability  in disposal  and we are required to deliver the project in so many daysand there are so many programs.<p>

We decided what is going to be the development strategy,  what is going to be theintegration effort actually the integration pattern then the integration effort and we wereable to come out with the numbers for the time required for completing each activity andthen using the PERT CPM approach we could easily come out with the time required forstarting and finishing the individual program and by  making sure that the totaldevelopment time was not contradicting those calculated by the COCOMO effort.<s>
