We studied the  problem definition phase, with which we generally start our development lifecycle where we tried to state the problem clearly try to characterize it, and give a scope of effortand time to the user.<s> The next step we discussed was the feasibility step, where we give differentalternatives to the user we work out their costs and benefits which mean include both the tangiblebenefits as well as the intangible benefits.<s> And then we started discussing the important phase ofrequirements  analysis: where we specify inputs, processing and outputs.<s> Primarily we said thatthe requirement analysis phase goes outside-in where we start by looking at different outputsthat the system has to provide to the users or different type of interactions that the system has tosupport for the users.<p>
