As you go through the data flow diagram, you start getting good idea of what these datastore should contain.<s> The car data store should contain not only the car details but alsothe price at which it was purchased.<s> The repair details should contain not only thedifferent repairs that were carried out,  but the price or the costing of those repairs.<s> Wetake all these details into account and decide on the price.Then there is process 4  which periodically creates new advertisements.<s> It has torefer to the cars which we have for sale.<s> It has to look at the past advertisement, so thatyou do not advertise the same car again and again and keep you know advertising thosebrands which receive lot of attention from the future buyers.<s> These advertisements areprepared and sent to the newspapers.The process 5 which does the selling.<s> It interacts with the salesman,  buyer  andnaturally it has to obtain the car data from car data store and  it may have to obtain therepair data from repair details in case the buyer wants to get the repair history.<s> After thedeal has been made when the car has been purchased by the buyer at some negotiatedprice the buyer details will also be stored in the buyer data store.<s> Again this may be forfuture requirement or may be even a legal requirement to know whom we have sold thecar.<s> We may also update the car data store when the car has been sold and can also keepthe selling price in our data store.<s> These five processes together describe all theprocessing requirements of the car mart organization here.As  you  can see, these five sub process taken together carry out all the applicationrequirements.<s> You can think of these five processes as a running together and performingtheir tasks, as and when they are required.<s> So a diagram like this with proper naming ofall the elements of that diagram conveys the entire processing scenario to the reader ofthe diagram.<s> As I said earlier,  as we go through the diagram,  we understand the datastores well in terms of various details.<s> In fact if you use a good tool, you can use that toolto describe each data store that we had identified in the diagram.<p>
