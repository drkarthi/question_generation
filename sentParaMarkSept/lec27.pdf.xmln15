So the analogy is clearly one of building hardware out of using prebuilt components suchas chips.<s> You  do  not  build the gates for example within  the hardware  design  today  youhave chips with three built pieces of functionality.<s> For example,  you may get a 4-bitadder, for example, you may get a piece of memory that stores certain 10 5 4 words of 8bits each or a byte each and you can assemble a larger memory set by taking a bunch ofthese memory chips and putting it together;  you can assemble a computer by puttingtogether memory blocks such as this; even there there is a level of componentization.<p>

Typically you get memory cards which contain let us say 4 mega bytes of memory or 8mega bytes of memory and each card is in turn built up of smaller chips that contain maybe a kilo byte or memory each  and  the  entire memory card can be plugged in in anextensible way to create a computer that ranges anywhere from let us say 64 mega bytesof RAM all the way to Giga byte of RAM and you can extend that and this in turn usesthe other components such as you know an arithmetic logic unit, may be a floating pointprocessing unit,  a  CPU  and  so on and  so forth,  a disk driver and so on.<s> So that is theanalogy that you should be thinking of when you are thinking of component basedsoftware engineering; can I do the same thing that I do in hardware in building hardwareto building  software systems as well  and that is what component based softwareengineering is all about.<p>

Components can provide different levels of abstractions as we have noted down in thisslide.<s> Typically most of them tend to be data abstractions  or functional abstractions.<s> sothe component either implements a single function such as mathematical libraries that areavailable  so there  can be libraries of you know mathematical functions,  there can belibraries of UI  components, there  can be libraries of you know communicationcomponents and so on or there can be data abstractions so things like data structures orlisps and stacks and sets and bags and hash tables and so on so these are data abstractionsso that can exist as well.<s> Rarely  is the component  of complete  system abstraction thatbecomes cots  type of reuse  but for the sake of completeness we have included all thetypes of component abstractions that can exist on this slide.<p>
