Algorithmic models  basically are based on the past  data and often heuristic models arefitted to the data and without knowing why you know that incase you have a dependentvariable you know how it is related to the independent variable.<s> So the causal relationshipis not known  but the actual relationship you absorb is known.<s> So you can use thesealgorithmic models for making reliable estimates based on the past data only a-priory youhave a past data.<p>

Now,  incase  if  you do  not have the past  data you need to rely on the data collected byother  people in industry and publish it.<s> There are not  too many publications,  people donot often like to display or share their  performance data but  some industry models areavailable and you can use those as a  starting point and then modify those particularmodules to fit your environment.<p>

Now,  in particular,  some techniques like FPA are  going to be very good for doing theestimation in phase of incomplete data at a very early stage in the projects life.<s> So thesekinds of estimates help you in providing envelopes for making some trade off decisionsand so on and so forth.<s> They are also useful during the subsequent stages for conformingor verifying the estimates that you may get  by  other alternative means.<s> The algorithmmodels have disadvantages that some algorithmic models depend on estimates like line ofcode which can be given until you are fairly  deep into  the project.<s> That  means thoseparticular models cannot be used in early stages of the project.<s> Then in reality thecontrolled experiments are very expensive, difficult and rare.<s> So we have to rely on thedata  as is where is  take it or leave it.<s> Then  parameter values are also organizationaldependent and you might find that from one extreme to another extreme you cannot getthe same variations.<p>
