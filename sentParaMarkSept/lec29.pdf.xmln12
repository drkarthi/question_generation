Then we have another particular evolution and this is a difficult one to explain.<s> Usuallydefense projects easily fall in this particular category.<s> We are trying to look for a solutionwithout knowing what really is the best solution in the situation.<s> so you evolve and  youtry  it  out  and  if you find that you are happy  stay there if not  try to look for the nextparticular phase.<p>

Now, today most of these particular projects have a deadline commitment and in case ifyou are interested in meeting a very stiff deadline then undertaking evolutionary kind ofan approach would be a difficult task but if you had enough time, money and resources atyou are disposal you could undertake this particular approach.<p>

Last  but not the least is the concept of increment like this.<s> What  is incremental  design?Suppose there are several functions to  be delivered by an  application  then you cancategorize  this particular function; you can categorize this particular function  in a ABCminor and say that which function will deliver the maximum benefits to the organizationwith minimum time, money and effort involved and like doing a ABC analysis meet theA category functionality first and then the B category  so this kind of  approach  is  verydifficult to implement if you are contracting the project outside;  this may work well incase the resources required for the project are being committed within the framework ofthe organization; within the framework of the organization.<p>
