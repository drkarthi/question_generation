The  third law is called the  fundamental law of program  evolution and basically what itsays is that software evolution itself is self-regulating in nature.<s> So, if there are too manychanges and the change is stopped because it is no longer possible to make the kinds ofchanges that are being made continually.<s> Also, there are certain statistical trends that canbe observed so there are average number of changes that takes place say every month forexample  or  every three months once in a quarter and  so on and there are certainobservable variances around these  kinds of averages or mean  and those are fairlyobservable.<s> So it is not a random process of change that is happening all the time and thisis  the  observation of these  two people over several different projects that they havestudied.<p>

Also, the next law is one that Fredric Brooks has also stated in his software engineeringbook which is just throwing people; more people at a software project is not going to helpit happen  any  faster.<s> This  is stated slightly differently here.<s> What  this states  is  that nomatter how many people work on that the output is going to be constant of a developmentproject  so the more people you end up throwing at you probably just create more workfor  yourself and you are not going to end up producing anything more out of that sameproject.<p>
