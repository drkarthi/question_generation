In airlines industry for instance they go one step further that there were insurers  for theaircrafts and they are reinsures for the aircrafts so that the risk is further subdividedamongst the  larger number of participants than just a few.<s> In  general the risk transferalways involves paying the risk premium; it is akin to paying an insurance premium.<s> Soyou might have warranties, performance bonds or whatever else that you might to need torespond to in this particular manner.<p>

Contracts may use this particular risk for fixing the price of the contract to a contractor.<s> Ifthe project design is stable then what will happen is  otherwise  this  particular thing.<s> Socontracts may be used for transferring the risks  so  you  give this lump sum  basis tosomebody else to do.<s> If you want to develop some critical driver or some such particularsoftware it is possible for you to subcontract that.<p>

We  have different types of contracts  like  reimbursable contracts and many  otherparticular cost plus basis contracts and all that.<s> Another particular approach is mitigation.What you are doing basically in mitigation, we are trying to lesson the risk.<s> The first twoapproaches are one was not to take it and the other was to shift the responsibilitiessomewhere else.<s> Now  we  are  trying to reduce the probability of risk and reduce theconsequential loss arising out of these risks.<s> Now we need to look at it from a differentpoint of view.<p>

So if you look at the slide we have a lessening of the risk associated with the probabilityinto that.<s> So  one approach that we could take would be to reduce the probability ofoccurrence of the risks.<s> If  you are minimizing the probability of the occurrence  of  therisks then reducing of the frequency of errors or reducing the opportunity to make theerrors can both help you in reducing the probability.<s> Reducing the frequency of errors canbe for example entering the data once instead of several times so that the integrity loss isnot there.<p>
