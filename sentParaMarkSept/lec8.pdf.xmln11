This is an example again of a data flow system but something that focuses on interactionwith external systems more than the data flow within the subsystem itself.<s> The subsystemis pretty simple here, it just consists of two steps that of analysis and the insulincomputation step.<s> The change in the data that is happening is first the parameters aregotten from the sensor.<s> Once the parameters are gotten, the blood sugar level is calculatedand that is another piece of data that is created.<p>

Finally the insulin computation function will output a third piece of data which is theamount of insulin and goes after external systems.<s> DFD do not necessarily focus on theflow of data within a subsystem or within a system that is being built.<s> But can alsoillustrate the interaction of these subsystems with external subsystems as well.<p>

Moving on what we look at is the other aspect of behavioral models.<s> The other aspect ofbehavioral models is  state machine models.<s> State machine models essentially try toillustrate what the response of the system is going to be like to external as well as internalevents.<s> It could be that if you take a microwave oven for example an external event couldbe somebody turning the microwave oven on and it responds in a certain way to thatwhich it turns on and runs for the amount of time it is set to.<p>

An internal event could be something such as a fuse that goes of and when the fuse{bursar}  goes off typically that comes to a halt and there is a response to that kind ofinternal event as well.<s> Or there could be a change in the data of the system and thechange in the data might trigger something.<s> For example, date.<s> When you are crossingover to the new millennium the behavior of the system could end up changing in someway.<s> The state models are often concerned which showing the response of the system tothe stimuli and typically used  for modeling real time systems and they are also veryuseful in non real time systems as well.<s> These models typically show the different statesto be the nodes and the arcs between the nodes.<s> Essentially illustrates the different eventsthat are occurring.<p>
