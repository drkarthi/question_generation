These are the three main applications of these classes.<s> The concrete class is mainly usedas it is they are directly available in the real life domain or you can use them as library.The pure abstract classes are used for capturing the general behavior or the commonbehavior through inheritance.<s> The partially implemented classes are very useful inframeworks.<s> So we can see that the three levels of abstraction you talk of objects whichare instances of classes.<s> When you talk of classes, it defines structure and behavior of aclass of object, a full category of objects.<s> So that all instances of that class then guaranteewhatever behavior that is guaranteed by the class description.<p>

Then there are Meta  classes which are classes of classes, if you want to describe classlevel attributes.<s> For example,  you want to keep the count of number of instances of agiven class.<s> Where are you going to keep that state?<s> Are you going to keep that state inevery object?<s> That will be unnecessary redundancy and then you have to again maintainthe consistency.<s> Instead if you maintain that attribute, number of instances of given classwithin the class itself and you can ask the class to give the number of instances that it hascreated then you are talking of behavior of the class itself.<s> You are going to invokemember functions on the class.<s> That means the class is also going to be treated as anobject, as an instance of its own class which is called Meta class.<p>

When we want to model class level attributes,  when you want to design some thing atMeta levels, we are talking of class level attributes.<s> Then we need this modeling ability orMeta  classes.<s> These attributes are at Meta  level and the member functions are at Metalevel.<s> The member functions invoke those attributes that describe that Meta level.<s> Theyare invoked on classes themselves.<s> In such a system, classes are treated as instances.<p>
