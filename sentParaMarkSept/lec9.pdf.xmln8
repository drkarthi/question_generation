Depending on the situation we are modeling, we have to define binary relationships orternary relationships as appropriate, so that the association among entities is  clearlycaptured.<s> Another important thing is that a  relationship itself may have attributes.<s> TheSTUDY  relationship has attributes,  the grade and the semester.<s> The grade will tell uswhat grade the student has received in that course.<s> Suppose student Ganesh is studyingcourse CS101 and he gets A  grade.<s> This grade A must be treated as a attribute ofSTUDY,  it is not a attribute of student Ganesh because just saying that student Ganeshhas got A grade is not enough, you have to say in which course he has got that grade.<p>

Therefore it is neither the property of student nor the property of course but it is theproperty associated with the relationship between the student and the course.<s> This is animportant point because grade cannot be defined as attribute of student nor it can bedefined as an  attribute of course but it must be defined as a attribute of STUDYrelationship.<s> Similarly the semester in which the student has registered in that course willbe an attribute.<s> We always define these attributes for the relationships as we see them inthe application domain.<s> Relationships are named using verbs or nouns.<s> Here are a fewexamples  Study  is a relationship as we have seen.<s> Enroll  or Order,  a customer mayplace an order for a part.<s> So order will be a relationship because customer is an alreadyexisting and defined entity,  part is an entity.<s> Order relates customer and part.<s> So theserelationships should be named using either  verbs or nouns and they should be chosenvery carefully so that the meaning of the relationship is conveyed to the user.<p>
