Here what you are assuming  is you have a group of people  who  really do  not need tocome together or do not need to discuss because in case  they start discussing there arelikely to be  other problems, there is  no reason for them to sit together and work at thesame time and come out and arrive at a consensus.<s> Here every individual is free to givehis own particular opinion and this opinion is shared with other experts without knowingwhose opinion is that and the coordinator ultimately reconciles the estimation.<s> So severalexperts are needed so it is a very expensive kind of a proposition and the advantage inthis particular case being the experts may or may not be at one location and somehow youcan make do with such situations.<p>

There is a coordinator,  what the coordinator does is initially explains the task  to  all theexperts, give them the specifications for the particular task then each expert is suppose todo the estimates based on the information and past experience and send  it to thecoordinator,  the coordinator then reconciles, summarizes  all these particular things, incase  you  find that there  is a wide variation amongst  these particular estimates then theexpert may be asked  to give an  explanation as to why in that particular experts opinionthe estimate is very large or small and this data is circulated.<p>

Looking at the estimates made by the other experts depending on their own  pastexperience and the explanations given by the estimator, each estimator may like to reviseone estimate and in course of time the consensus will be arrived at or the gap between theextreme estimates can be brought down to a reasonable or a pre-determined agreed level.<p>
