Strategic planning for quality and quality improvement programs  was not done  as welland  it was very essential for doing it for improving national economy.<s> Dramaticimprovements in cost of quality could not have really been brought up without having aformal quality system and concept of quality improvement directly had to be used by allorganizations.<s> So, quality management programs of this particular time can be successfulonly if they are management lead, customer oriented then of course there is some kind ofappreciation.<s> So in case on a national level people who excel in quality the way they do itand what they have  achieved.<s> Then some kind of recognition  can greatly help inpromoting the concept for quality.<s> This will also help in documenting some best practicesand enable others  to use those particular practices for improving there own state ofaffairs.<s> So if you look at the slide now the US public law Malcolm  Baldrige  NationalQuality  Improvement act of 1987 recognizes the US companies which excel in qualityachievement and quality management.<s> And the law is supported by some foundation.<p>

Now the law is aimed at encouraging quality improvements  in all sectors of a  [..17:41]both big and small and manufacturing and agricultural mining and construction you nameit even service organizations.<s> If it  is aimed at creating public  private  partnership makesure that the quality becomes the  corner stone of all the work that happens.<s> At themoment three are eligible categories  known as  the manufacturing,  service and smallindustries small businesses specially those employing less than five hundred people andevery year two awards in each category could be given if required.<p>

Of course if the organization gets an award once then it is not  eligible to apply for asecond award.<s> So any profit making business located in US both in the public and privatesector, domestic or foreign joint venture companies were all eligible.<s> But the local, stateand national government and non profit organization, trade  association  and professionalbodies were not eligible to apply for this particular award.<p>

Now the frame work for national quality award model is centered on seven examinationcategories.<s> Let us look at the slide now.<s> The first particular one is leadership.<s> So what doyou do?In  your application you need to specify  that how do the senior executives  provideleadership to the organization in excellent quality.<s> They  have to facilitate,  create andsustain clear and a visible quality value system.<s> Build  quality valued  in the way theorganization does business, project the quality values outside the organization,  andsupport  the quality development for within and  outside the organization.<s> So what theyconsider for evaluation is  the appropriateness,  effectiveness and the involvement of themanagement.<s> It does  not look whether you have a formal quality department like  youhave a label somewhere and you say this is the quality department which is not enough.So the quality department need not be located as a separate department  but it needs toachieve this particular thing and needs to provide a leadership to all concerned.<p>
