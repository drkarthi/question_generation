Active acceptance of risk involves preparation of a contingency plan.<s> That is, if things gowrong what we will do  which is executed if the risk materializes.<s> So,  preparing thecontingency plan is to make sure that we do  not start thinking after things are gonewrong.<s> Remember,  preparing  the  contingency plan is a part of the risk managementactivity.<s> Even if you want to build the expense in that sense to the project management itis not exactly like a  risk mitigation activity  but making a contingency plan is a veryessential kind of a thing.You might sometimes have a fall back plan, if the risk strategy is weak then change thescope of the project, choose another alternative, go to another site, go to another projectmanager, allot more contingency funds and so on are kinds of back up or fall back plansthat can also be there.<p>

We  can also use triggers for  tracking such risks  and we say if things appear to godwindling  in a particular manner then we will take  this.<s> Suppose  we have a team ofhundred and we are worried about the project members leaving the team and we say ok ifthe number of people leaving the project exceeds five then we need to put a contingencyplan into action.<s> But  remember,  risk acceptance does not mean not thinking about it,  itonly means that we think and consciously take a decision that we would not like to haveanother particular mitigation activity or other situation as such.<s> So, if we look at the slidenow we have the contingency action.<s> The contingency actions are aimed at limiting andcontaining the impact of risk if they happen.<p>

From  that point of view in case the customer hardware is not in place  for  acceptancetesting  it may be performed by hiring resources at an alternative site.<s> Similarly,  if thehardware is not going to be  available for testing you could think in terms of using anemulator for doing that particular job.<s> These  actions get identified during the planningstage however these things are not going to be put in practice at an early stage.<p>
