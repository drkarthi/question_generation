Similarly, success rate of a project can be improved by better control over the project.<s> Atrivial analogy would be falling from the first floor  that of a  building as against  rollingdown the staircase.<s> You would really want to know only at the end of the project that it isfelt  you would like to make sure that you periodically check to make that the project isstill on course and it is being conducted in an appropriate manner.<p>

Another  thing is with time the management must continue to commit resources to theproject and it  is not possible to commit these particular resources unless  you know thatthe earlier allocation of resources has been well utilized.<s> So the management review of aproject is aimed at evaluating its progress, it is likely successes and basically answeringthe  question  whether  to continue to invest in this particular project.<s> So,  managementreview of the project needs to occur at least one level above the project manager on anongoing basis.<p>

Now, a project manager works within the framework of an organization so it is unlikelythat the project will succeed unless it has a full commitment from the top management.Typically  a performing organization may sponsor  several projects  and there are severalfactors that are not under the control of project manager but he needs to still work withinthat.<s> so we expect that if  a project is to succeed the top management needs to give acommitment  so that they give guidance to  the project manager they tell them  they tellhim their objectives and priorities,  they have approvals which are done on a timelymanner,  executive level contacts is  easily available with project and the  customerssupport during the conflict resolution is also provided,  cooperation from the othermembers of the performing organization,  the support group  within the organization isobtained and last but not the least the top management also needs to mentor the projectmanager.<p>
