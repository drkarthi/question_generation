Now it could happen that the requirements of the software change as the software isbeing constructed and there may not be time to fold in the new requirement that arecoming in during the processes of creation of software because there are certain deadlinesthat people would have to meet in order for the software to be rolled out.<s> Also,  newrequirements can come in; completely new requirements that would have to enhance thesoftware after it has been pressed into service.<s> So, for example, you could have a librarysystem that has been built and one of the new requirements that would come in where thenotion of being able to rent articles for a certain fee or download articles for a certain feeand print them.<s> So here the notion of accounting package could have to be added to  anexisting software system that was in service.<p>

Other  reasons could be that the business environment in which the software is livingchanges and what could be the result of such a change in business environment.<s> Anexample of such  a  change could be that a  business might end up buying out anotherbusiness, the business processes within the original enterprise where the software existedcould now change as the result of the buyout or the merger acquisition or the merger as itis called in business terms.<p>
