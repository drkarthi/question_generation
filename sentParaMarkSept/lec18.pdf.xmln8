Now there are some interesting issues regarding these drivers and stubs.<s> Let us considertwo different cases of top down and bottom up integration.<s> So let us see how do we test,how do we carry out our testing plan, what should be our testing strategy for top downintegration.<s> (Refer Slide Time: 31:03)<p>

We have these seven modules in this particular structure.<s> Module  A  uses module B, Cand D. Module C uses module G. Module D needs modules E and F. Now when we wantto do an integration from a top down point of view, we will first test A, then we are goingto test B,C and D. Then we are going to test G, E and F after B, C and D gets tested.<s> So inthe top down fashion you are going to integrate everything.<s> You  test the main modulefirst and then you are going to do integration test for subsequent model.<p>

In top down integration first you develop the main or the central theme of the entiresoftware.<s> The main will be ready, but your remaining modules may not be ready.<s> Forexample, only your main A is ready but B, C, and D are not ready.<s> Meaning, when youare testing A, BCD may not be ready.<s> But when you are testing A, A is completed, yourmain module is completed.<s> But the function on which the calls are made from main arenot yet ready.<s> So how are you going to test A?<s> You will test A with stubs of B, C and D.So make stubs for BCD and then test your module A.<p>

Now when B is ready you can test B.<s> Will you require a driver for B?<s> You will not need adriver because  A is  ready.<s> Similarly  for C  you  wont  need a driver because A is  ready.But you will need a stub for G because G is not ready.<s> So you can test BCD with stubs ofG, E and F. Drivers are not needed to test BCD because A was ready before BCD.<s> So Aitself is a driver for BCD.<s> When the actual code that makes calls on BCD is ready, you donot need drivers for BCD.<p>
