CK that is Chidamber and Kemerersuite and MOOD metrics suite are the two importantsuites which can be looked at, but there are many other metrics available.<s> For example,you can measure number of methods in a class, average number of methods per class ordepth of inheritance tree,  how deep is your inheritance tree.<s> If  it is too deep then it  isconsidered  to  be  very complex in terms of say the behavior,  different polymorphismpossible  or  the tracing required to understand which method is going to be invokedthrough the inheritance tree.<p>

Number of children,  coupling between objects,  response for a class or RFC,  lack ofcohesion among methods that is LCOM,  attributes  hiding factor,  method inheritancefactor,  attribute inheritance factor, polymorphism  factor,  and coupling factor.<s> These aresome  various  metrics available in the object oriented domain as well and the  mainreferences for these are the CK and MOOD papers.<s> You can pick them up and they arealso covered in many text books.<p>

Some of these are quite simple and they can be enabled through tools or also by manualaccounting.<s> These measures are useful.<s> As we can see that,  we are trying to measurevarious attributes, which connects  to quality of the software and then we want to feedback into the quality of the software based on the measures.<s> For example if you find thatclass is not cohesive,  you may want to redesign your  system or if you find that there isvery heavy coupling between two classes, you may want to reconsider the design or youmay want to move or you may want to apply some refactorings on your design andreadjust your collaborating classes or the hierarchy, so that these figures improve.If you have some quantification  of you design and  code,  you can use that in order toredesign the system  or re-factor  the system.<s> So  this is very interesting approach tosoftware evaluation and refactoring.<s> You can do it based on the metrics as well and if youhave the  set  of tools available and if you have the expertise available that can make itpossible to interpret these measures.<p>
