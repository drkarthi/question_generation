There are fairly large entities, the level of granularity in a framework is quite high so itmight act as an entire system  for example,  it could be a framework of an inventorymanagement system or an ERP system within the industry or it can be a framework forGUI designs such as MVC designs and so on so it is fairly large.<s> However, there has tobe some work that is to be done by the person who is reusing that framework.<s> So thereare  different classes of frameworks  that are available.<s> There  are  system infrastructureframeworks, there are middleware frameworks, there are application frameworks and soon depending on the level in the stack that you add.<p>

System infrastructure frameworks basically are things like communication frameworks sothere may be a  socket based communication framework,  there  may be a  multicastframework that is available that supports  multicast based on IP or  something else andthings like that.<s> So there can be user interfaces frameworks and so on.Now,  the middleware integration frameworks  are typically those  that support a certainstandard such as code bar for example it may support a J2E standard, it may support a dotnet standard  and it supports  communication between components here.<s> The  frameworkfor example, may go beyond simply a piece of middleware such as an ORB by saying Iam going to provide reliability to this  piece of middleware by  replicating the object inmultiple places.<s> So it  is a framework for object replication in other words.<s> That  is thenotion  of middleware at the I mean thats the notion  of frameworks in the middlewarelevel.<p>

And finally the frameworks  at  the application level are  those  that  are developed  thatsupport the development of specific applications.<s> So inventory management was  anapplication that we just talked about, there can be frameworks that do different types ofvertical domains as  well so a framework that does account management for example sosomething that have to be fed into that would be the account management,  businessprocess, the tax tables for the account management so it needs a lot of things just like acomponent  has certain required interfaces and has certain interfaces that it ends upproviding  and the  framework also has certain requirements  the  things that it  ends updepending on as well as it has a set of services that it ends up providing.<p>
