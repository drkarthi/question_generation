We may take another base line for completion of design.<s> Now we do not have a base linefor completion of coding for a simple reason that all coding never gets completed at thesame time.<s> So  the next base line that we have is when the integration of the product isdone.<s> that is, the first time when all components are put together the entire product lookslike and functions like a single system and then this particular system is subjected totesting  namely the system testing,  acceptance testing etc.<s> So  whenever the product isaccepted  and the product is handed over to the customer,  like saying you wind up aparticular product then you make it an acceptance base line.<p>

Similarly, in case you had a convergence project then the base lines would be like initialsource base line will be there then a filtered source line etc.<s> Filtered source line is passingall the source codes  that you received through a  program to alter it to the targetenvironment  which  probably will do may be 85,  95%  of your work and the remainingfew percent of the work you will have to do it manually.<s> So, once that work is done youwill have a converted base line.<s> And last but not the least when you release the productyou  will have a release base line.<s> Therefore the  configuration base lines are veryimportant from software projects point of view.<p>

The next particular thing that we want to understand is configuration control.<s> What do weunderstand in configuration control?It  involves evaluation,  coordination,  approval or disapproval and implementation ofchanges to the configuration items.<s> How is it organized?Look at the diagram.<s> The simple thing is, on one side you have the work area and on theother side you have the customer and the third party and we see that no job will everleave the work area and directly find its way to the customer, it must always go through aCM configuration control.<p>
