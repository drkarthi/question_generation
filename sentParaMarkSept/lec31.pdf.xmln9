I gave you an example;  time required for completing  a program  or  time required fortesting a program or the number of bugs that you expect in say thousand lines of code, allof them could really depict some kind of a probability distribution and then based on thiswe can get a distribution of results that are likely to come, probable results with differentor a particular thing.<s> Once we have this situation in our hand we can use the simulationtechniques for  assessing the feasibility  of the entire project schedule in case of adverseconditions.<p>

Also,  simulation will help you in preparing mitigation plans and continuance  plans tophase the undesirable situations.<s> So you can try out this particular situation and find outyou whether you are well within your risk profile or not.<s> So when you have done all theseparticular considerations right from sequencing to availability  of resources trying outdifferent  alternatives,  crashing of networks and fast tracking and leveling of resourcesand all that ultimately some kind of a schedule will come out for your project.<p>

Now,  after all these  problems you would have sort  of expected the schedule to runwithout any problems for the rest of  the projects  life but that is not so.<s> Changes  areinevitable;  changes to  every aspect from the scope to quality to schedule and  to manyother  particular  things are inevitable.<s> So  you will find that during the life of a  projectvarious aspects pertaining to schedule may change.<s> Change in availability of resources isthe simplest thing.<p>
