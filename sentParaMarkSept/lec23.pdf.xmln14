So we use our experience in working out the cost for such an  environment.<s> So we findthat the server and operating system or other whatever that needs  at the various workstations might cost as about 4 lakhs rupees.<s> The database management system might costabout 20,000 and the application software development will cost as about 30,000 rupeesand one of the important component of this could be initial data entry for all the booksthat we have in the library and the existing users of the library.<s> Now this is the significantone time cost which is required in order to go live, if we are doing computerization.<p>

So all the data about the books and the members must be online.<s> This might cost as about2.5  lakhs.<s> So the total cost of the system is about 7  lakhs rupees.<s> We consider secondalternative where instead of doing the data entry manually at the counter, what we wouldlike to do is to use bar coding so that books can be bar coded as well as the membersidentity cards can be bar coded.<s> So this will avoid data entry time at the counter.Moreover it may also reduce errors which takes place at the counter.<s> So in this case thereis some additional investment required, 3 bar code readers may have to be purchased thatmight cost additional 1.5 lakhs.<s> And there is a cost of bar coding the books and memberidentity cards.<s> So this is another 1.5  lakhs and the 7  lakhs of the systems anddevelopment.<s> So  the total cost for alternative 2  becomes  10  lakhs rupees.<s> We nowexamine each alternative for feasibility.<s> Both  alternatives are obviously technicallyfeasible as well as operationally feasible.<p>
