So in general the modules which call each other may have some data items flowing fromthe calling module to the called module or there may be some  results which are goingback to the calling module.<s> This is the data which flows as  parameters between themodules when one module executes or invokes another module.<s> As you see here againthe modules are organized at different levels.<s> The Task 1 is a module at level one and theother three modules are at level two.<s> The module at level one, which is the Task 1, is theone which invokes or which  calls the modules at the next level and not the other wayround.<s> This is the hierarchical structure that we enforce on the software design.<s> Softwaredesign then therefore consists of identifying these  modules and the  hierarchy of thesoftware.<s> This hierarchy represents the architecture of the software.<p>

If necessary the modules on the level two such as the processing  module can bedecomposed further.<s> So the hierarchy can consist of multiple levels.<s> Depending on thecomplexity we can keep decomposing till we arrive at a module which is clearlyspecified, and which can be implemented in terms of a coding code module which canbe converted into a program.<s> The modules at higher level generally do the coordinationand control, whereas the modules at the lower levels do input/output and computations.This is exactly what we saw in the previous diagram.<s> The module at the higher levelwhich was the Task 1 is the one which gets work done from the modules at lower level.<p>

So it obtains inputs, it obtains computational results and it passes them from one moduleto another module.<s> So the task of coordination and control usually gets done at themodules at the higher level, whereas the modules at the lower level you can think of themas worker modules.<s> They actually perform the tasks such as the input/output tasks and thecomputational tasks.<p>
