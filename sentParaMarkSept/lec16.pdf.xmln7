The require keyword is used to specify the preconditions.<s> The count is less  than  thecapacity, and item x is not in the object or in the set and the actual implementation codecan be specified.<s> When you are designing, this implementation code is not provided, butwhen you are implementing this code can be stuffed, the preconditions  and postconditions.<s> The post conditions  described by ensure  class.<s> It ensures  that  it has x andcount is equal to old count plus 1.<p>

So these can be directly used in implementation.<s> The class can be compiled without thecode first when you design.<s> In  your design,  you just translate into this template ofcontracts for every member function and then when the implementer implements thisclass, which is designed, using this design by a contract, he stuffs in the implementationthere.<s> The exceptions etc  can be thrown by the programming language.<s> If you do  nothave the support in the language use alternative constructs which are described fewminutes ago.<p>

Class design works for exported member functions, an interface, as public compartment,implementations for  the  specifying class only and implementation for this  specifyingclass and for  its subclasses.<s> Till now we looked at exported member functions and theinterface which is public compartment.<s> The design and we looked at it design by contractand we looked at the CRC method of decomposing classes and looking at theresponsibilities of the classes and collaborators.<s> And then another two important aspectsin class design when you want a detail or when you want to give the design of theimplementation before the actual code is written.<s> They are the implementation for thegiven class and implementations for the specifying the given class and for its sub classes.<p>
