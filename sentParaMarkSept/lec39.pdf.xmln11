Another  important process that we have in overall integration is  the overall changecontrol.<s> Again  we saw every knowledge area always started with planning and endedwith change control.<s> By  the same token all the change control themselves need to beintegrated.<s> So  the overall change control involves identifying,  evaluating and managingthe changes throughout the projects life cycle in all areas.<p>

If you look at the slide again the objective of the overall project plan control process are;first to influence the factors that create the changes.<s> Our basic objective is to ensure thatthe changes are minimal and if they do occur they are beneficial.<p>

(Refer Slide Time: 46:23)<p>

Second particular part is determining that the changes have occurred in the way we thinkthey have occurred.<s> And  last but not the least managing the changes when  they occurbecause you would not like the changes to occur as and when.<p>

Therefore  from that particular point of view integrated change control process involvesfirst ensuring that the changes to a product scope are reflected in the definition of thescope, the coordinating changes across the knowledge areas like proposed schedules andall that are affecting all the other areas that we have done and maintain the integrity of theperformance base line.<s> Hence all these things need to be managed by the particular thing.While  you are doing this another particular issue is there and that is organizationallearning.<s> We have already said you cannot keep on making the same mistakes all overagain and the organization must learn from the past mistakes.<p>
