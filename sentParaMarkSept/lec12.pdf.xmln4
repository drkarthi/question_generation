For example we will not show things like the airline number which is given by thecustomer is wrong or the destination city that he has given does not exist in our databaseetc.<s> We assume that such errors will naturally be handled by our software,  but they areroutine type of errors where data validity has to be done, these are not shown as a part ofdata flow diagram.<s> We concentrate on main functions and main processes rather than getdistracted by routine type of exceptions.<s> Process  must be independent of  each other.Again here we refer to our thumb rule that cohesion and coupling are the guidelines wealways use for any decomposition.<p>

When we define sub processes, we should ensure that the new sub processes that we havecreated are cohesive in terms of what they do and there is minimum interdependencebetween them.<s> In fact,  the only way the processes or sub processes interact with eachother is through data.<s> Work of a process should depend only on its inputs and not on thestate of another process.<s> So processes are independent in that sense and this is animportant point we must observe when we are doing the refinement.<s> Only needed datashould be input to the process.<s> This is again an obvious requirement that a process shouldreceive inputs which it needs for producing the outputs which are the responsibility ofthat process.<s> As we do refinement we must also ensure consistency at different levels ofrefinement.<s> Here is an example where on the top we show a data flow diagram in whichprocess F1 has been defined as having input A and producing output B<p>

This process F1 itself may be fairly complex and this process may be decomposed intodifferent sub processes.<s> Let us say we are decomposing the process F1 into 1.1, 1.2, 1.3and 1.4 as four sub processes with relationships among them.<s> This decomposition hereshows that a complex process such as F1 gets decomposed into four processes whichhave been named as 1.<s> 1, 1.2 and so on, to indicate that they are part of process 1.<s> In thiscase the consistency among the levels requires that the inputs at the sub process level 1.<s> 1should match with the inputs in the process F1.<s> Inputs and outputs must match even afterdecomposition.<s> On the other hand new data stores may be shown.<s> For example, for theprocess F1 in the top of data flow diagram, we did not show the data store but when wedecomposed F1, a new data store have surfaced (ex: level 1.3), because it needs to supplysome history data or past data to one of the processes.<p>
