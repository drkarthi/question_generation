Then we need to identify, in how much time the system must react to the input of the transaction.Or totally in a particular given time which may be the peak time, how many transactions shouldthe system process in a  given slot, which could be one hour or something.<s> So these are thecapacity requirements which are important to be specified and they are specified from the userspoint of view.<s> And these are defined by taking into account, what are the actual requirements ofthe organization.<s> So after identifying these, we identify the various design constraints.<s> Now theseconstraints may be in terms of the development standards.<s> The organization may have veryspecific standards for developing the software.<s> Or it may be standards for various reports.<s> Forexample in the financial world lot of reports are required by regulatory  authorities.<s> So thesereports must be as per the standards.<s> Then there are  auditing requirements.<s> So these standardsneeds to be complied with and those must be clearly identified and  they  are identified in thissection.<p>

We  also identify any hardware limitations.<s> For example the user may have  already somemachines, operating systems; database systems etc and we may need to develop the software forthe  available environment.<s> So these would be treated  as hardware constraints or systemconstraints.<s> And finally we state  any other requirements possibly mentioned here the futureextensions for the software.<s> This is the overall format for the SRS document which is giving acomplete specification of the software in terms of what it would contain.<s> We must note here thatall sections which are listed here may not be required in all projects, because some projects maybe very small in scope.<s> But in most cases, these different sections would be necessary becausethey cover various  aspects not only the functions, but they cover constraints, they definefunctional requirements, they define performance requirements.<p>
