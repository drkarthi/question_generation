Specially  the marketing people in their zest for getting others may go and makecommitments which are not realistic, never  hesitate to call a spade a spade.<s> Get  all theaffected stake holders involved in preparing the schedule.<s> It is not a theoretical schedulethat you are preparing on a piece of paper but  ultimately what is important is that thisschedule works in practice.<p>

How will you be sure that this particular schedule works in practice unless all the peoplewho are affected by the schedule concur with the schedule?So you must involve all the stake holders in preparing the schedule and obviously havetheir tacit  acceptance of the realisticness of the schedule.<s> Then prepare a detailedschedule and get the stake  holders  approval where possible in writing, customers forinstance.<s> It would be a good idea on your part that the schedule is formally accepted bythe customer.<s> So getting the schedule done  and getting it accepted is a totally differentparticular activity.<p>

Schedule  progress meetings  with the stake holders periodically must take  place.<s> Theseparticular meetings will take place at two levels, the minor particular thing is within theteam then at the project level with the project manager and then with the top managementand when required with the customer.<s> So the  progress meetings will highlight or bringout  if  there are any  problems with the schedule and those particular problems must betaken care of and resolved.<s> Always remember, do not spring any surprises at any of thestake holders.<s> Do not pose fact to say that this particular thing will be delayed.<s> Anticipateand say  that  this is likely to be delayed, how the conflict is to be resolved,  let all theconcerned  people put their  heads  together and come out with the agreed modifications.So schedule control must be done.<p>
