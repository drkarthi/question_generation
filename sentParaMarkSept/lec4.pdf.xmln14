There is a  data  item named x which is flowing from get input and going towards Task 1.Basically here, what it implies is that the Task 1 needs this x and it has given this responsibilityto the get input module.<s> So it calls the get input module and receives from this model.<s> Thedata item x which it may then pass to the processing module.<s> As you see here, the x data itemis traveling from Task 1 to processing.<s> The y data item is actually being produced as a resultfrom the processing and it is being sent back to the Task 1.<s> The Task 1 is then passing this y tothe produce result module.<p>

So in general the modules which call each other may have some data  items flowing from thecalling module to the called module or there may be some results which are going back to thecalling module.<s> This  is the data  which flows as parameters between the modules when onemodule executes or invokes another module.<s> As you see here again the modules are organized atdifferent levels.<s> The Task 1 is a module at level one and the other three modules are at level two.The module at level one, which is the Task 1, is the one which invokes or which calls themodules at the next level and not the other way round.<s> This is the hierarchical structure that weenforce on the software design.<s> Software design then therefore  consists of identifying thesemodules  and the hierarchy of the software.<s> This hierarchy represents the architecture of thesoftware.<p>
