Scalability  is  another feature and finally the workflow management metaphor;  does ithave a  workflow engine that is in there,  does  it  have any kind of capabilities tographically define  workflow and business processes to this  and then  subsequently thesethings can get automated.<s> So these are some of the criteria for evaluating the suitability offrameworks and are  frameworks the best form of reuse is hard to say,  frameworkcertainly provides a higher granularity of reuse compared to components but that can alsobe a disadvantage in terms of when you are extending the system the framework does notsupport it now you might be in a fair bit of problem at this point in time.<s> So it depends onhow extensible it is and how you can integrate this with other components and additionalframeworks and applications.<p>

Also, the degree of understanding that you would have to achieve in order to make thisframework approach succeed would have to be quite high.<s> So you would have to get intothe  guts of the framework and understand exactly what these  interfaces do  and  exactlywhat  are  the interconnections between these  different interfaces  because your extensioncapability depends on the understanding at the end of the day.<p>

So  the next level of reuse that we are going to talk about is what is called cots productreuse.<s> Cots  stands for common off-the-shelf products.<s> Common  off-the-shelf productsare essentially entire systems or  applications that have been built that you are going toreuse in certain scenarios.<s> Cots systems usually offer some kind of an API but you mayand this API would be used for integrating the system along with other systems.<p>
