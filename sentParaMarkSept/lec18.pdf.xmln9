Similarly when you want to test GEF, you do not need any stub and you also do not needdrivers because actual modules of C  and  D  are ready before G, E  and  F. So when youwant to test with top down integration,  you have to look into the cross sub stubs.<s> Youneed the stubs for the lower levels when you want to test higher level module.<s> But you donot need drivers because the high levels are ready.<s> When you go to lower level,  thehigher levels themselves can be used as drivers.So these are some interesting points or interesting features of top down testing throughtop down integration.<s> Secondly, we can compare that with bottom up integration.<p>

In this, you test the  leaves first and then you integrate them one by one into the higherlevels.<s> For example when you want to test G what will you need?<s> You do not need anystub because G does not make calls to any low level modules.<s> But C is calling G. C is notready, only G is ready.<s> You are going to test G when C is not ready.<s> So you need a driverfor  C.  Similarly for E  and  F  you need a driver for D. In order to test GEF,  you needdrivers for  CD  and  A.<s> When you want to test BCD,  you do  not need stubs for  GEF,because the low level modules are ready.<s> But you need a driver for A.<s> When you want totest A, you do not need any driver nor you need any stub, because all the low levels areready and A itself is the highest level module.<p>
