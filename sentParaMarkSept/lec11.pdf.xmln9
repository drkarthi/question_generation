We  now have seen that a process would be decomposed and we will do decomposition atmultiple levels till we reach elementary processes.<s> A diagram can be used for representing thisdecomposition.<s> It would be having structure of a tree and we will have this elementary process atthe leaf level.<s> In doing the process decomposition diagram we are showing only  activities.<s> Weare not showing any data in these diagrams.<s> So remember that process decomposition diagram isonly giving decomposition of the various processes.<s> Here is a fairly simple example of a functiondecomposition diagram.<s> The process that we want to consider is the process called studentregistration.<s> Student registration may be a fairly complex process.<s> So we are dividing it intothree sub processes.<s> The first process is called register for backlog courses.<s> If a student has anyfailed courses in the past, then he must first register for them.<s> Then the second process is, hemust register for prescribed courses and then the third subtask is to get the registration approved.<p>

Hence  student registration consists  of these three processes:  backlog registration,  prescribedcourse registration, and approval of the registration by the faculty advisor of the student.<s> Here isanother example, inventory control.<s> In the inventory control, an organization wants to ensure thatstocks that it keeps in its warehouse are of appropriate quantity.<s> It has to mange that inventory.Student registration may be a fairly complex process.<s> So we are dividing it into three subprocesses.<s> The first process is called register for backlog courses.<s> If a student has any failedcourses in the past, then he must first register for them.<s> Then the second process is, he mustregister for prescribed courses and then the third subtask is to get the registration approved.<p>
