So in case you are using  COCOMO method then it is better that  you exactly followBoehms definition of DSI.<s> DSI excludes undelivered supports of testing utilities, drivers,tubs, comments, generated codes, substituted code, reuse code components etc.<s> So it is inthis particular context that one needs  to be very careful about making sure that you gotthe right thing in and got nothing else in the DSI that you count.<s> Once we got our initialdata assume we have done some kind of a higher level design and you have been able tomake a broad structure as to what will and will not be a part of your system.<s> And  hereyou see that we decided that we are going to have three programs; an update program, areport program, this  report program will generate all the five reports that we need andthere will be an enquiry program.<s> Therefore, from our point of view we are going to havethree programs in this particular system.<p>

Now, using the Delphi and data distribution kind of approach we get a group of peopletogether and ask them how big  will  the  update program be and in this case the  groupseems to have concurred to say that it will be minimum 250 lines, most likely 300 lines,not more than 400 lines and then using A plus 4B plus C by 6 kind of approach you cansay that this particular module will be 308 lines.<s> The query module will be 104 lines andreport for all five reports together will  be  616,  the total is going to be 1028  from  ourparticular point of view and then this will constitute the 100%.<s> Therefore,  walkingbackward you see that your update report is going to be 30%, your query report is goingto be 10% and your general reports are going to be 60% of the code.<s> So we look at thisparticular kind of a data and look at the COCOMO equations now from that particularpoint of view.<p>
