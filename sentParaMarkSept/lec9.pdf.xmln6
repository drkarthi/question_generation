Let us note some points about this example.<s> We will further refine as we proceed and wewill also take many such simple examples from the university environment, because it isall familiar to all of us.<s> We can always prefer to take examples from universityenvironment, but we will refine these four entities that we just now introduced.<s> There arevery important points to be noted,  the first point is that our focus could have indicatedmore entities.<s> We must remember that in the college environment there can be additionalentities.<s> Hostel could be an entity; Semester could be an abstract entity.Or instead of naming teacher as entity, we could have named teacher as an attribute ofcourse.<s> So that we say that course have a teacher.<s> How do we decide in a givenmodeling situation whether something is an  entity or not?<s> This would depend on thefocus of our design or the focus of our application.<s> How do we perceive the reality?Hostel in the real world is obviously an entity, its a physical entity.<s> It has rooms, it hasaddress,  and it  has a warden and so on.<s> It has many interesting attributes.<s> But in theapplication we are developing, the purpose of the hostel may be only to act as an attributefor a student to tell us in which room number or in which hostel number the student isstaying.<s> In that case we are not interested in hostel directly, but we are interested in thehostel through student entity.<p>

So we will have to decide what is the focus of my application?<s> Do I need to know who isthe warden of the hostel?<s> Do i need to know some other details of the hostel?<s> In that case,hostel will be an entity.<s> But if the role of the hostel is only to tell  me where a studentstays then, I can treat it as an attribute of student.<s> This important point must be kept inmind that what is the perception we have,  what is the focus of our applicationdevelopment and based on that you will identify the entities and attributes.<s> We cannotloose this perspective throughout the modeling exercise.<p>
