Then we are ready to develop or to prepare the documentation for this particular phase whichresults in the preparation of what is called the software requirements specification document.<s> Wewill now look at  the  format of the Requirement specification document.<s> Is  very important tounderstand these clearly because this is one of the very important documents as we said earlier itbecome a baseline for a contract between the user and the developer.<s> It is expected to contain thecomplete requirements which are adequate to tell the user what he would get from software andit  also  adequate to tell the designers and developers subsequently for the completeimplementations of the software solutions.<p>

So let us understand the documentation format which has been standardized by IEEE this is theformat that we are discussing is as per the recommendation given by the IEEE  organizationswhich has made lot of recommendation for softwares standardization.<s> The first section is theintroduction section.<s> It first establishes the purpose of this document; what exactly is the purposeand what is covered in this document?<p>

Then it defines the scope of usage; who will use these documents and for what purpose?<s> It givesvarious definitions, abbreviations,  acronyms  as they may be applicable  and which have beenused in the rest of the document.<s> It may also refer to other documents which have been preparedand which have been referred by the user.<s> For example, these may be documents made availableby the user which define some parts of the requirements or these may be documents which areprepared during feasibility step.<s> All these documents can be referred here clearly in the SRSdocument.<s> Finally the introduction will also briefly specify the responsibilities of the developer;what exactly is the scope of the project?<s> Does it include development, installation, training,maintenance, and support for a limited time etc?<p>
