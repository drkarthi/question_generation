Should the library go beyond this point at all?<s> So for example if the analyst feels at thispoint that a system like this based on this past experience may  cost  something like 50lakhs rupees then there is just too much gap between the resources available and theresources required and therefore it may be best not to proceed beyond this point.<s> But atthis point the analyst indicates that up to 7.5 lakhs rupees seems to be a reasonable scopefor the project and the gap is not significant and the library maybe able to find additionalresources if required so that the solution can be worked out in the required cost.<s> So at thispoint the analyst proposes that we can do the next step that is the feasibility step.<p>

It can be done in two weeks  and may cost the library rupees 10000  and if the librariangives a go ahead signal then we can proceed for the feasibility step.<s> At this point the shortstep of problem definition concludes with a problem definition document.<s> This documentsummarizes the problem as we understand.<s> So  this whole phase of problem definitionphase may not take in this case more than half a day or one day and at the end of whichwe prepare a small document summarizing the definition as well as the scope for thisproject.<p>

Now we have also noted who are the users of this system, the users of this system are theassistant librarian who is in charge of the circulation function then there are a set of clerkswho function at the counter of the library who issue book, who receive books and thenthe users of the library who are faculty and student.<s> So you have made note of all thesethings and now we are ready to prepare the problem definition document.<s> Now  thisproblem definition document we had seen the format earlier.<s> Its a very simple documentwe just give a suitable title to the project as circulation.<s> The essential features of theproblem are noted down that the present system is too slow and it is not cost effective.<p>
