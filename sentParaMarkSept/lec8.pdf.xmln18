Similarly ER diagrams can be complemented with what is called data dictionary and datadictionaries are basically the lists of all the names that are used.<s> For example the librarysystem there was the author,  there was the purchasers  relationship,  the relationshipbetween the author and the article, there was the publisher etc.<s> There were differentthings; there were entities, there were relationships, and each entity had a certain numberof attributes and so on.<s> First thing, avoid duplication of names.You should not have two entities even in two subsystems which are called by the samename, because  the data base  model may be a common model between  multiplesubsystems of a software application.<s> As a result of which you do not want duplication,this helps you avoid that.<s> It is also a store of all the organizational knowledge and gives aglance what is this entity really trying to represent, what is the relationship whether youare trying to represent, when was this constructed, by whom was this constructed.<p>

For example, if I want to enhance a relationship or enhance an entity with an additionalattribute, then you might want to go back to the author and say I am going to change thisis it okay and so on.<s> Here is an example of a data dictionary very concise and it showslike two or three things relating to the library system that we just talked about.<p>
