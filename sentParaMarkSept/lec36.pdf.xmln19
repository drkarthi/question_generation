Now we are using a terminology in terms of doing the assessment first at a macro macrolevel and then at macro level and then at a micro level kind of a situation.<s> So  your gapanalysis is done on a basis.<s> Hence once you have got some idea about what are the broadweaknesses  that you got in your organization  you  can start planning to overcome thesekinds of weaknesses.<p>

Action planning:Remember, the whole idea is once the very fact that you want to do an assessment meansthat you would like to take a step forward and find out where you are weak and thoseparticular activities can be initiated.<s> Once  you got the initial class  C  weaknesses andcontrol the next thing that you are going to do is to do the formal part again.<s> So on oneside you are going to do process enhancement.<p>

We will already have some processes in writing but these processes need to be improvedon an ongoing basis and improving the process is not good enough the improved processneeds to be implemented.<s> So  you  have the process enhancements and processimprovements.<s> You have more and more processes and they are put in practice.<s> And onceyou have done that you can do a class B kind of assessment, a pre-assessment.<s> And onceyou do a class B kind of a pre-assessment you will know again where you are lacking andwherever you find the gaps then undertake the closing  of the gaps for pre-assessmentkind of activity.<s> Once you have done this then the next particular thing is you would liketo have a formal assessment.<p>

Now remember, the emphasis on CMMs is on self assessment.<s> Usually the assessment isdone by people within the organization under the guidance of a trained person, somebodywho has achieved proficiency  and  has got a certification in SCAMPI approach methodthen this particular person is going to do that particular job.<s> So what you are really goingto do is when you want to do the formal assessment you are going to systematicallyidentify a group of people so you will make sure that there is no bias in the sense that youpick only favorites or you pick people only from certain areas and not from other areasover one project.<s> Therefore systematically you choose good people.<p>

Those particular assessment team members, as shown in the slide  this assessment teammembers are trained by the leader the 10% who is going to guide the assessment and thenit is these ATMs really are the ones who go in the whole company to different areas as itall planned like who is going to go where and do what kind of checking etc.<s> They go anddo the relevant measurements and come back and under the guidance of the facilitator allthis data is put together and then the group as all keeps on deciding which particular levelcapability level or the maturity level needs to be assessed and when the entire assessmentis complete at the end of it you will get the appropriate certification.<p>
