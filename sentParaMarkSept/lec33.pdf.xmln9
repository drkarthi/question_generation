If you look at the screen you see that there are two basic COCOMO equations.<s> We haveonly seen the application development organic mode,  MM  Man  Month  as we havedefined  is equal to 2.4  KDSI  into  1.05.<s> So Man Month  in COCOMO is 152 hours, 19working days in a month.<s> Please remember a person works for 22 days but 3 days may beoccupied in either doing companys  work, being  on leave, away for training and so onand so forth so useful days out of 22 is going to be only 19 and it is assumed that it is notpossible to substitute  a  software developer for a day on a day today basis as a casuallabor.<s> Then KDSI is Kilo Delivered  Source  Code instructions and if you look at thatparticular curve you will see that the size of the code goes on increasing, the man montheffort will go on increasing more than linearly.<p>

Now, TDEV is the Time for Development and this is given as 2.5  into  MM[20:45].<s> Soonce you have done the MM calculation  you can substitute this figure here and thisparticular number indicates that the time required for developing the software is less thanlinearly proportional to the site development effort.<s> Thereby, if you add 100 man montheffort  then 200 man month effort then  the time to delivery for a 200  man month effortwill not be twice as much as the time to delivery of the 100 man month effort.<p>

Once you got this particular data that is once you find the total number of man months etcusing MM  by  TDEV you  can get something called full-time software developmentpersonnel as the measure or the project indicating that how many people we really needto deploy on this particular project.<s> If you were to have this data we need to now again dosome adjustment factors.<p>

First let  us look at the adjustment factors and then see how  these are used.<s> COCOMOdivides the adjustment cost,  divides  the cost drivers into four  groups.<s> The productattributes,  the computer attributes,  the personnel attributes  and project attributes.<s> Theproduct attributes,  the computer attributes and  the personnel attributes  to  a  large extentare not under the control of the project manager whereas the project  attributes aredefinitely within the control of the project manager.<p>
