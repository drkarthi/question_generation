Now, if a is found to be false, then S2 checks for b and b could be false or true.<s> Wehave a branching here.<s> We are first branching at a, if a is true then execute x and wecan continue and we do not need to check for b.If a is not true, then the lower path istaken.<s> In S2 we check for b, if b is true then we execute x and then we join at the endof the conditional statement.<s> If b is false we execute y and then we again join at the endof the conditional statement.<s> So in this case we have this flow graph where we have twobranches.<s> This is an example of a compound condition.<p>

Hence,  we need to carefully look at these compound conditions  and formulate  the flowgraph.<s> Otherwise, we will miss some of the branches, then they become implicit and youdo not cover them  all.<s> This  will result into errors  getting undetected  because of notcovering all the basic paths in the control flow graph of your program.<s> Now, we will lookat measure called cyclomatic complexity and see how that  gives us a clue to generatingthese basic paths.<s> We have looked at all these basic statements and their flow graph.<p>

In a big program you have to analyze the entire program and generate the flow graph ofyour given program and then find out how many paths in the entire flow graph should betested so that, you will cover all these statements of the program and you can satisfy yourcertain coverage.<s> Typically a program includes many branches and many statements, andyou may have many such paths and you need to cover all the paths.<s> How many cases arerequired?<s> We have to reduce the number of cases, but we should also make sure that allthe statements  get covered.<s> There is a measure  called cyclomatic complexity and  thatmeasure  actually tells  us how many paths we need to  generate,  so that these  criteria issatisfied.<p>
