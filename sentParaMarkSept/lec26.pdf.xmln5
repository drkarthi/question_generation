Therefore, the main difference stands between incremental development and prototypingis that both start with requirement  and specification and the increment is  basicallyresulting in a delivered system as we see here.<s> So an increment  is something  that  isactually used by the user eventually; it is put into production, it is actually used and thenthe user gives feedback on that so  it  is not a toy  system  it  is not a test system in otherwords whereas if we go down the prototyping path that is become down this path then theprototype is constructed it is  not incremented but it  is constructed and the prototypeessentially leads to a system specification; it could lead to a system design which is also adesign specification of sort but essentially it leads to a better way of doing this; the bestway of doing this is usually found out so the  best set of requirements  of  the system isfound out,  the best specifications  for  the system,  the best design for the system etc sothose alternatives can be validated using prototypes.<p>

So the conflicting objectives of these two different ways of handling agile development isthat the objective of  incremental development is always to deliver a working system tothe user as quickly as possible but having very small amount of functionality.<s> So, usuallystart with requirements which are best understood requirements, which are unambiguous,which are clear and so on whereas the objective of the throw away prototype in fact is tosolidify those requirements  that are very ambiguous so you typically start with arequirement which are very ambiguous,  which are not well understood and try toprototype those ideas then show it to the customer the customer never ends up using thesystem in any way they only end up using it in a test mode just to see whether what theyhave asked to be constructed is indeed what they want so the prototyping process alwaysstarts with requirements that are very very poorly understood and this leads to a processof refining these  requirements  so that they are understood much better by the systemdesigners going forward.<p>
