The second point is the system.<s> Here we need to have several particular considerations.Information analysis is one of them.<s> Now what happens is you have data but you are notable to make any meaning out of it and then you are in trouble.<s> So, information analysistells you the adequacy of scope, validity, use of the management data on the organizationsystem.<s> So basically this is the way you encourage a preventive kind of approach and theconcepts like management by fact.<p>

One would like to hear from you all the time like a background kind of a music our datashows that and that is  why  we took a particular kind of action.<s> So it considers  forevaluation the appropriateness and effectiveness of the methods, the technology and howthis particular quality related data is managed  in the organization, how is this particulardata analyzed and how it is used.<p>

Again  to repeat;  it is not necessary that you have a formal information processingdepartment or how that department is organized or which technology uses by itself is ofno consequence.<s> You can have a very simple kind of a technology and the job being doneetc but what you need to show is that you have the data and that  data is being used forprevention and detection and continuous improvement on an on-going basis.<p>

Now the third particular point is strategic planning.<s> All these things cannot happen unlessyou plan.<s> Again you keep saying  plan,  plan,  plan  because  basically  management  is allabout planning but planning at a strategic level is very important, adequacy of approachto planning like do you set short term goals or do you set long term goals or do you setpriorities etc is not possible for you to  achieve everything all at once in one goal.Therefore you need to say what you will do now in short term and what you will do in thelong term.<s> So  it is one thing to say that  you would  like to be the most outstandingsuppliers of a particular product and another thing is to say that you would like to reducethe number of defects from  five defects per million to  three defects per million andsomething like that.<p>

Therefore,  integrating the quality planning with  business planning is  very important.There is this famous story of a dog food manufacturer who ultimately confesses that hegot the ISO 9000 certification but the dogs did not like the dog food.<s> We do not want toget into that kind of a situation.<s> The success of the business is as important as ensuringquality, but whatever it is the two are in a true sense not separable.<s> So when you plan forquality you are actually integrating your plan with the business plan.<p>
