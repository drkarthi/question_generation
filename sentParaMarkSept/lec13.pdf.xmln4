Extending is going to cost a lot and may be new technologies would have to be used orentire system might have to be upgraded and so on.<s> The autonomy of modules stronglyinfluences.<s> What this really means is the degree of coupling is got to be very low and thestrength of cohesion or the degree of cohesion within a particular module has to be veryhigh.<s> We will go into the details of what exactly that means in a little while.<s> The next oneis reusability of the software.<s> The ability of the module to be useful in multiple scenariosor the multiple situations  directly  is going to affect the quality of the software.<s> This isalso related to robustness, because if a module has been tested before, it is being used inmultiple situation before,  then  it is likely that people will safely use it again and thatwould lead to a reduction in cost and it will lead to increase in quality.<p>

Modularity essentially refers to the notion of extendibility and reusability.<s> How well is itencapsulated is what we are talking about when we refer to modularity.<s> Other factors areportability; the ability to  execute on a wide variety of platform.<s> For  example,  does  itexecute on Linux and on windows or does it work with the Netscape browser as well aswith the IE browser and  so on.<s> The ability to execute on various configurations is whatportability refers to.<p>
