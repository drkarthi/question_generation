That is defining the property of the push operation per say and the way of testing the factthat push will only push the element once on to the stack and that element is  alwaysgoing to be the topmost element of the stack.<s> So if you do quickly a TOP operation on thePUSH of a new stack, which is guaranteed to return single element that is pushed on tothe stack.<s> This example is trying to illustrate very simple higher level of abstraction thatwe are trying to create out of a stack data type.<s> Now this can be applied to pretty muchany module that you end up with specification.<s> It could be a date specification that youare trying to write down.<s> What you are trying to do here is put some constraints on thebehavior of what this data type is going to be capable of doing when it is implemented bythe designers and the developers of the system.<s> This has to be done upfront as much aspossible.<p>

What these axioms essentially help us at the end of the day is that,  we can do certainalgebraic manipulations using these axioms.<s> No matter how long an algebraicmanipulation you have given, the rules will always guarantee that you end up with a validvalue.<s> That is what the rules of the axioms are meant to do.<s> An example that is shown onthis slide is a fairly long example you are taking a stack, you are doing several operationson this.<s> You are creating a new stack, first thing is that you are pushing the value x4 on toit, then you are pushing x5 value on it, you are popping it so on.<s> It is a huge combinationof operations that are being performed on this and work this entire expression out there isnothing but an expression in the mathematical model that we have created.<p>

We can work this out just like an algebraic manipulation  you can reduce certainexpressions  down  to simpler expressions.<s> Given the rules that we have,  we can reducethis particular expression down to a single value that eventually comes out of it whichhappens to be x4 in this case.<s> What is important is that this single value x4 for thisparticular expression is going to have to be true.<s> No matter how the stack is going to beimplemented down the line.<s> That is what the power of the axioms gives us at the end ofthe day.<s> So  essentially it gives us the quality that is unchanging about stack,  no matterhow it is going to be implemented.<p>
