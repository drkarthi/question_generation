So,  in practice  what happens is some change request have to be fixed  urgently;  theturnaround time has to be twenty four hours or less in case it is a major bug so the systemis crashing and  giving a particular input  is not an acceptable situation  and in suchsituations you would always almost have to turn around the request very very quickly butsome things can be scheduled for a particular release and done in an appropriate mannerwith requisite amount of testing and so on.<p>

We will not go too much into the change implementation; the implementation procedureis very similar to that of the development procedure so you take a look at therequirements,  analyze the requirements,  you come up with  design changes that has totake place,  you do the development, do the testing and so on and all these  can be doneiteratively just like we showed in this spiral model where very very incremental or smallchanges are done to the software so as to not disturb the stability of the software througha large change or multiple small changes should not be done together; you do one change,you test it, you do another change test it and so on and so forth.<p>
