What it means is that, this model therefore cannot represent a multiple supply from thesame supplier for the same part.<s> This may not be appropriate  and  this may not be whatever real world needs.<s> We need to modify this.<s> When we discuss this with the user, userwould indicate that this part of his requirement or this part of the real world is notcaptured by the model correctly.<s> We need to think about how to modify  this model.<s> Infact, in a way this problem is related with the problem that we discussed in the previousdiagram where we talked about  the student repeating  the same course with the sameteacher possibly in another semester.<p>

Once we try to understand the problem, we will be able to come up with the solution.<s> Inboth the cases you see here that the two models  that we have are not handling thesituation that we want.<s> Basically we want to distinguish between the different suppliesmade by the supplier.<s> Supplier may supply parts, each one of them is a shipment by itself.We need to distinguish the shipment on its own rather than distinguish it through primarykeys of the entities which are participating.<s> What it means is that, we need to distinguishthe instances of the relationships on their own and therefore it cannot be modeled as arelationship.We need to think of this in a different way which will allow us to distinguish oneshipment from another shipment irrespective of what it contains and where it has comefrom.<s> We need to change this part of the diagram so that it captures this requirement.<s> Ihave already given a hint that we need to create an additional entity because entities aredistinguishable in their own right and by creating a separate entity we should be able toaddress this.<s> Here is a solution we can propose for the part which we did  not findsatisfactory.<s> As you see here, we have created an entity called shipment and this entityhas its own key called shipment number.<s> With this key we can distinguish instances ofshipment from each other.<p>
