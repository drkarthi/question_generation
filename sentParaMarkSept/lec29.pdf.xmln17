Then the very important area is risk management because the planning often is done in adeterministic manner but things do  not  happen the way they are planned.<s> Very  simpleexample is people leaving the project mid way.<s> So, one is to take care of those activities.You may have a situation where you have a strong penalty clause in defect rates after theproduct is delivered and you may be faced with the situation whether to test it yourself orto test this particular program from outside  and last but not the  least the procurementmanagement.<p>

Now,  the procurement management does  not  necessarily restrict itself to procuringhardware and communications material for the IT project.<s> Many times software needs tobe bought.<s> Drivers for devices is a very common example of things which are not madeby people but what;  similarly in case you are interfacing your hospital informationsystem to the  laboratory information system  the interfacing device required  forintegrating your hospital information system with our laboratory equipment will oftenhave to be bought from outside.<p>

Now,  with object orientation the components may also be bought  from outside and youmay have many other ways in which the procurement of software can be done to meet thefinal aim of the project.<s> Now these areas eight areas do not work well together unless youhave a integrating  function.<s> For  instance,  any change  in  scope will have an  impact  ontime will have an impact on cost, quality; it may involve procurement, it may involve riskall kinds of things.<s> Similarly,  any changes  in any one of these particular areas aredefinitely likely to affect the other area.<s> So, one cannot make these changes without sortof having a holistic view of all the knowledge area.<p>
