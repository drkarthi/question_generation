Once  you got the once you got the plan in hand your next particular thing is to executethe project.<s> Now,  obviously project execution consumes maximum resource.<s> Thisparticular process involves implementing a plan.<s> This  process involves implementing aplan.<s> So, by and large this is the biggest consumer of resources.<s> but we do not do projectexecution without appropriate controls; the monitoring and control, the feedback and thecorrective actions is the essential part that runs, hand in hand with the execution.<p>

So basically the controlling involves, again, substantial amount of re-planning.<s> Once wegot that the last but not the least is your closing processes closing processes.<s> What are theclosing processes?<s> Closing processes basically bring the project formally to an end theclosing processes bring them.<s> So, getting a sign off from the client, settling all the bills,filing and handing over all the project papers to the librarian, making sure that all the endof phase reports are completed,  the learning experience from the projects are  welldocumented and the process improvement that may arise out of the projects activity allthose activities have been initiated so this really brings the projects to a close.<p>

These  kinds  of activities are happening individually for each phase and also for theproject as a whole; are happening individually for each phase and also for the project as awhole.<s> Now there is one more thing that we need to specially in todays  environment itneeds to be brought out that no project can ever be done well unless the project manageris very conscious  of his professional responsibility.<s> A  project manager should notundertake responsibility of managing the project if he is not qualified or trained for doingso.<s> So this is only one particular aspect.<s> There are so many other issues involved in beingpaired  in allocation of work,  responsibilities,  and assignments  of load to  people andmonitoring the progress, reporting correctly, not pushing things under the carpet all kindsof things will fall under the professional responsibility.<p>

So what happens is this;  if you were to now look at it within each particular phase youhave initiating,  planning,  controlling,  executing,  closing  processes  going on and theseparticular processes from one phase linked  with similar processes with the subsequentphases.<s> So  the project works  in this particular manner where the processes from onephase are linked to processes activated during the subsequent phase.<p>
