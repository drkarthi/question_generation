Look at the third particular objective of this particular hospital (in aut.30:11) to relivethe hospital staff from repetitive and clerical work.<s> Have you  not heard of social workagencies where they train social workers,  spend two third of their time in pen pushingrather than going and doing social work in the field, meeting the children or aged peoplewhatever they are do because the system makes a lot of demands on this particular kindof  activity.<s> So,  to relive the hospital staff from repetitive and clerical works is a  verymajor objective from this hospitals point of view.<p>

Another particular objective is to assist in education of hospital staff on an ongoing basisby providing an overall view of the hospitals healthcare system and its organization.<s> It isvery important that we train people as close to reality as possible without really having toactually  work in the field without experience and then  learn by making mistakes.<s> So,training of people is a very important issue with all the organizations and this particulartraining can be done to a large extent also by sharing information that is available that isaccumulated by the organization or period of time.<p>

Last but not the least is to provide the hospital management with a tool for measuring thecosts and performance of its activities.<s> Now remember,  in the past there has been amisconception that the charity hospitals;  hospitals  usually  were optional;  so started bycharitable institutes  that costs  and performance are not there  judging factor that  is verywrong.<s> See,  cost is the other side of resource  consumption.<s> there is a resourceconsumption and cost are two sides of the same coin and a hospital maybe a charitableorganization and it may not be wanting to cost and price  its services but it is veryessential for it to realize how much resource is being deployed in the end product that ithas produced.<s> So these particular objectives  as they are specified  by the UniversityHospital of Geneva in Switzerland I am sure many organizations produce this particulartype of documents.<p>
