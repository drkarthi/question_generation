In the last lecture we were taking a look at the process of software reuse.<s> We looked atwhat exactly is reuse and what are the different factors that affect reuse;  what are thebenefits and disadvantages of software reuse  and we saw that the main benefits to begroup from reusing software at various levels.<s> The first one was that of reliability so thecomponents or  the  cots  software that you are  reusing essentially would have been welltested in previous situations possibly previous production  situations and the  bugs couldhave been I and doubt so the problems could have been fixed so the degree of reliabilityyou get by reusing such a component is fairly high.<p>

We also saw that they was reduced process risk because of the fact of reuse so you do nothave to get involved  in that much more  of the estimation process  given that thiscomponent already exists and simply be reused as is independent project and an obviousbyproduct of the whole thing is accelerated development so you can do rapid applicationdevelopment with components stringing  them together and just providing the loopbetween these components and certainly the compliance to standards may come for freebecause largely components that are meant to be reused are cots software or frameworkthat are meant to be used that typically those that are here to certain standards.<s> So  thelevel of compliance for these standards within your own software goes up by that much.<p>

The disadvantages of reuse clearly are that evolution of your software may not be simpleso maintenance becomes much more expensive because of the fact that the componentsthat are in there may not evolve along the direction that the application which is made upof these components is evolving.<s> Certainly  there is also the issue of  not invented heresyndrome where programmers would like to primarily develop their own software.<s> So itnot much of a disadvantage as it is a factor that affects reuse and it is that unfortunatelyvery few standards have emerged for the construction of some component librariesworldwide  that you can  then go and  search for when you want a  particular component.So,  finding and adapting these components may not be a simple task as maybe evendeveloping your own component in some cases.<s> So these are the advantages and  thedisadvantages of reuse.<p>
