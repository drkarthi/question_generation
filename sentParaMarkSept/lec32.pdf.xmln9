Now, what are the characteristics of this, the customer has not paid you anything and theamount of data that is available with you is very little and there is a chance that you maynot  get the project.<s> So the amount of time that you want to spend on this particular jobalso has to be reasonable but the accuracy should be fairly good.<s> So the technique that werecommend for this particular purpose is called function point analysis.<p>

Function point analysis is a technique which can be used at the very early stages of theproject and it can work with very little data and give fairly accurate estimate, and it isalso very easy to verify.<p>

Now the next particular job is the top management.<s> This estimation is required after youhave got the job and now you are interested in this particular job being done.<s> So if youwere to  go back to our analogy of the four years of the engineering education of aparticular father then the total estimate for the education may be 4  lakhs  over  the fouryears but that does not mean that the father has to make available all 4 lakhs at once onday one and he needs  to  make  a lakh of rupees  available every year.<s> But the sameparticular token,  though  the project estimate has been made the top management is notgoing to give all the resources to the project manager on day one.<p>

For instance,  when  you begin your  system analysis the top management will give youonly those resources which are required for doing the analysis and at a later stage theywill give you the resources required for design and then for coding and then for testingand so on so forth.<s> So you need a different type of estimation which is little more in detailand the technique that we will study is called COCOMO that is Constructive Cost Modelby  Barry Boehm.<s> This function point analysis and COCOMO techniques  are two welldocumented techniques in public domain which can be used without any hesitation by allconcerned.<p>
