There must be some criteria, first lead to measure that means to count.<s> And come up withthe measures and then compare them, to associate them with quality factors in softwareengineering.<s> So one important point is about design, and then we also need to look at thecode.<s> Complex code is mostly hard to understand, test, debug and change.<s> If the code isvery complex, it will be hard to understand.<s> It also deals with styles, the algorithm couldbe the same, but the code that is written by different people differs.<p>

How much efforts will be required?<s> This is another use of software measurement.<s> If youhave the measures of your software or if  you  can predict,  for  example  the number ofclasses that are going to be required to implement your software.<s> You can find out howmany people will be required, how much time required that means you can estimate yourman months, you can estimate your cost.<s> To develop the software,  you need to find outhow much efforts are going to be required and this deal with your management aspect ofsoftware.<s> In order to design,  implement,  test,  maintain,  debug, and  deploy,  how mucheffort will be required.<s> So these measures can also be useful from that point of view.<p>

That is to say that software measure helps in decision making in various life cycle phases.So this is the relying motivation that if you are able to measure your software product andalso the process,  it basically helps you in  various kinds of decision making,  in variousphases of your software life cycle.<s> What are the attributes that can be captured?<s> Thatmeans what you can capture  through  these measures  about software?<s> Basically,  we aretrying to capture software quality  -  How  good  is  the  product.<s> Efforts or resourceestimates  -  We can capture them.<s> Progress of development  -  How far you haveprogressed,  how much is still remaining?<s> That  is  the most important question whicheveryone wants to ask when you are developing with deadlines in front of you.<p>

Complexity or difficulty - How complex is the task?<s> How difficult is the task?<s> Obviouslyyou want measure this and you want to capture these attributes through your measures.Process quality - How good is your software development process?<s> You want to capturethis if possible.<s> Quality factors: Usability, correctness, efficiency, modularity, portability,simplicity, understandability, security, robustness, completion that means how much youhave completed,  how many functions,  how many use  cases  have been over,  is it 90%complete or 95% complete etc.<s> You want to have these measures and based on these youhave some assessment of the quality of your software.<s> So measurement is quite importantand these are the attributes which we would like to capture.<s> Quality of your softwareprocess,  the progress of your development,  then the complexity and difficulty and alsothe efforts or your resource estimates.<s> We would like to capture these through measuresand correlate these numbers with some of these quality attributes.<p>
