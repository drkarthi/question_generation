We can see that this will not work for all the values.<s> If the value is just 1 then x will getadded to itself and the value will become 2  and you may never terminate this loop.<s> Sothis criteria gives you all these paths, the value of x to be 1 is good enough, but then onceyou get into this particular statement, you might not come out of this.<s> At the same time, ifit is stated that this loop works for this particular set of values, then you will be able to atleast cover these paths.<s> So you can  see that these criteria are not perfect  and they maynot still detect all the possible errors.<s> For example, boundary value analysis is not done inthis and typically you are mainly looking at only the structure of the code and theavailable statements and the available branching, through them you are covering the test.<p>

In this repeat statement,  this is the diagram or this is the flow graph of the repeatstatement.<s> Coming back to our flow diagrams and how to compute the basic paths;  wehave these S1, S2 and S3: S1 is your basic statement where you are incrementing x withtemp and incrementing the value of I and then you are going to S2.You can see that S2  is the branching node from where you have two outgoing  edges.Where as S1 is your elementary statement and from S2 you can come back to S1 or youcan jump to S3.You continue until  you get the  x  square, otherwise you  go  to  S3  andcontinue your execution after the repeat statement.<s> So, here we can see that there is thispath from S1 S2 S3 and in order to cover this particular edge you need to choose a testcase, such that you cover S1 S2 and comeback to S1 and then perhaps take S2 again andthen through S3  you come out.<s> Now,  we will look at another possible statement inprogramming languages such as C, C++.<p>

You have this switch case statement, where you have many choices at the switch nodeand you can fork into many choices and then join later.<s> For example,  here you have achoice.<s> If the choice is tea, then you prepare tea.<s> So, drink is equal to prepare Tea ()and then terminate the case statement.<s> Another case is, if the choice is coffee, then youprepare coffee.<s> If choice is juice, you prepare juice and so on.<p>
