In such situation we might rather decide to build a simple prototype and to find out eitherthe requirements or the techniques for implementation.<s> So prototyping model is anintermediate model or intermediate kind of a step in trying to define the requirements orthe solution approach.<s> Usually, we will develop a prototype and we will do it in differentstages.<s> And to begin with the prototype that we will build will be based on the user needsas we currently understand them.<s> Or the solution approaches as we understand them inthe beginning and we will review and refine them.<p>

Prototype might be either a working system or it may even be a paper prototype.<s> So ideain the case of prototype is to do a quick design and implementation and to illustrate theapproach or to illustrate the functionality to the user when these are clear.<s> So we do notwant to spend too much time and effort as well as resources in building a prototype withtoo much detail.<s> We want to do a quick design and in fact those features which are clearlyknown or clearly understood need not be implemented.<s> In the case of prototype the focuswill be on what is unknown, or not properly understood.<s> So prototype will be tuned as wedevelop it.<s> And when we try to satisfy customer needs, many iterations may be requiredto incorporate the changes.<s> Every time we complete the prototype we will evaluate it,tune it and decide what needs to be done further.<p>

Final product then would be built after the prototype is completed and is found to beacceptable.<s> This final product may be built using the standard waterfall type ofmethodology, where we will go through the design, build and test life cycle.<s> So here isthe diagram which illustrates possible steps in the prototyping model.<s> We start by quicklygathering the requirements.<s> Then focus on those which are not clear and which need to beexperimented.<s> Then we need a quick design, we build a prototype.<s> While building theprototype we may not care about doing too much documentation or look at themaintainability issues or even consider performance issues even if they are not relevant.Idea is to do a proof of the problem by demonstrating the unknown or un-understood.<p>
