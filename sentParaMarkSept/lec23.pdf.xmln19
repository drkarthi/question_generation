So we will be doing requirement analysis,  we will be doing design,  we will be doingdetailed design  and  implementation and we work out both the person effort and thecalendar time for carrying out these activities.<s> Based on which the library would know inwhat time period, it can expect the system to go live in the library.<s> So here we have givencalendar time for each of the important phases.<s> Then we have also note down someimportant points  that the computer system acquisition will begin at the end of designphase where we will clearly know what kind of a platform and sizes will be required.<s> Wealso noted that the data entry is a massive work and we want to contract it out and not doit through develop software development agency but give it to some data entry agencyand this work will begin at the end of the detailed design phase.<s> So that by the time wecomplete coding of the software and testing,  the data entry  would have been alsocompleted.<p>

So all these activities can be put down in the form of a implementation plan.<s> So we nowfinalize our report, we make a presentation to the users and to the management.<s> Let themconsider the different alternatives to the cost benefits and they will clearly tell us which isthe right alternative for them and which is the alternative they are willing to commit thecost for.<s> After this assuming that alternative one has been accepted by the users, we willnow proceed towards the requirement analysis phase.<s> In this phase our idea,  ourresponsibility would be to determine what exactly the system functions are.<p>

So the details of what the system needs to do would be defined as a part of requirementanalysis.<s> We will do this by defining the various inputs to the system, the outputs and theprocessing requirements and this must be detailed enough to complete the designsubsequently.<s> We will start by examining the feasibility study report that we had preparedearlier which contained a few data flow diagrams so we can make use of those.<s> And nowwe will expand them in more details.<s> During feasibility we have got some idea about theorganization and the circulation function that the library performs.<p>
