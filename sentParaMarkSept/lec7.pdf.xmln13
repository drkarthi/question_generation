One more basic operation that you can think of that might be useful is to determinewhether the given directory exists on this file system.<s> You can say that here is an ID,search the entire file system for me and return me a Boolean to say whether this is indeeda directory that exists within the file system.<s> ISNAME:  ID    BOOLEAN  we  havewritten out a few operations that we believe are atomic operations in this particular case.<p>

What we have to look at next is the notion of writing out the different axioms becausethats what is important to us.<s> What are the axioms that can be applied to differentoperations that we have.<s> We had a couple of PWD operations.<s> We can think of axiomsrelating to PWD.<p>

PWD of slash will always be the string slash.<s> For example,  if this is the root directorythat you are in and you ask for the present working directory in the root directory alwayshas to give you back the string slash.<s> PWD (/)  is equal to  /PWD of make dir (mkdir)command and mkdir command takes two arguments which is some directory and someID.<s> This is assuming that equals PWD of D itself.<s> PWD (mkdir(D,i))  is equal toPWD(D)This axiom is trying to point out the present working directory operation that isapplied to a make directory operation of D and i.<s> That means you are in D and making anew directory whose ID is i.<s> Then it is the same as applying the PWD operation to D,because you are not going to end up changing the directory in that particular instance.<p>

Similarly we can apply the PWD operation to the shield directory structure  as well andthen change directory also takes two arguments remember it takes D and i as twoarguments changing from the directory D into the directory i.<s> Here we can say that theresult of this operation PWD is nothing but the PWD of i because you are changing intothe directory i, so that is the result of this particular operation.<s> PWD (CD (D, i)) is equalto PWD (i)(Refer Slide Time: 50:16)<p>
