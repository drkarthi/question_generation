Now what you want to know is, what will happen over a period of time.So let us take a what if analysis kind of a thing.<s> Suppose we hire one extra programmerwhat  is  likely to be the impact of this  particular decision on the project schedule asagainst  we take a decision not to hire  this programmer  but to occasionally contract outsome few programs.<s> So what if analysis can be made using logic networks to simulatedifferent kinds of scenarios.<p>

Thus, delay in major component delivery or introducing some external factors like strikeshappening  in the city or there  may be natural calamities  and something like  that and incase we need to find out how will this affect the schedule, then we can take resource to,one is simple things like excel sheet but this will give you a very deterministic kind ofanswers.<s> If  you want more realistic answers to your  questions then one way is toundertake simulation.<s> Therefore,  simulation techniques are in at computing multipleproject durations with different sets of activity assumptions.<p>

Let  us take an example;  suppose you say that if I  assign a work to a  particularprogrammer then in how many percent of the situation does he complete the job beforetime and what percentage of time he exceeds the time required for completing thatparticular program.<p>

Now  we may make the assumption that 90%  of the time the job comes in time and  tenpercent is the delay but this assumption may not be correct and in reality that person maybe only eighty percent good in delivering that on time jobs.<s> So we may require trying outthat in case we make an assumption of ninety percent on time delivery of components asagainst eighty percent what  will be the total impact of this kind of outcome on theproject.<s> So we can use techniques like Monte Carlo analysis and make some assumptionsabout the probable distributions for each activity that we are performing.<p>
