If we first look at these different kinds of uses of inheritance, then we will apply thesedifferent kinds to our different class level design requirements.<s> You can use sub classesas pure extensions to super classes.<s> You can add new attributes; you can add newmember functions.<s> So your super classes may be concrete classes which we haddescribed earlier.<s> You can then add new attributes and new member functions to thosesuper classes.<s> You can use sub classes as full implementation.<s> This is applicable whenyou have a pure abstract class as a super class.<p>

And thirdly you could use sub classes as partially implementation.<s> These are applicablewhen your super classes are partially implemented.<s> So they are partly concrete,  partlyabstract.<s> These are again applications at same with peer extensions can be used whereyou have pure concrete library classes.<s> Full implementations have to be used when youhave intense hierarchies with abstract classes or they also have call interfaces mainly incomponent technologies.<s> And you can use subclasses as partial implementers inframeworks.<s> Inheritance for pure extension, inheritance for full implementation andinheritance for partial implementation: Mainly these three kinds of inheritance or thesethree kinds of subclasses can be used in class level designs with inheritance.<p>

There is one aspect of inheritance which I have not listed here but which is alsosometimes used, that is called mixings.<s> Use inheritance to actually represent part-whole.You have an object as many parts and the parts can be used as sub classes.<s> In this case,the whole is sub class which uses inheritance and using inheritance, one instance of eachof those super classes becomes part of the object or the memory map of the object of thesubclass.<s> This is called mixing.<s> But in this case one has to remember that the abstractionof the super classes is not exported by the sub class.<s> That means the inheritance cannot bepublic inheritance.<s> So the fact that the  subclass is using the super  classs parts onlyshould be reflected in our implementation through private inheritance.<p>
