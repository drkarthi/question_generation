Software EngineeringProf.<s> Umesh BellurDepartment of Computer Science &amp; EngineeringIndian Institute of Technology, BombayLecture - 25Software Evolution<p>

So far in the course we  have primarily looked at the process of how to create softwareand the different methods in the methodology that would be needed and useful to actuallycreate a software product for a system starting from the requirements.<p>

Now, once this software has been created it will be put into production and typically hasa  lifetime even beyond just the creation of software  and the process that comes aboutafter the software is created is that of software evolution or that of software change andthat is what we are going to be looking at in todays talk.<p>

Now there are various reasons has to why the software must be changed after it has beencreated.<s> it could even it could happen as long as the software ends up living all the wayfrom immediately after the software has been trust into production all the way through tothe lifetime the software system which could be upto several years.<p>
