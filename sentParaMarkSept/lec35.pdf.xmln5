The next particular question that we have is, it is all fine but how do we know that thethings are working the way we have  set it up  and  for that we need an  independentassessment.<s> So,  software audits are a  very important part of the Quality ManagementSystem.<s> Audit is  basically  a  systematic independent examination  to determine if  thequality, first of all that  you have planned the quality related arrangements, is everythingplanned so that the quality will be achieved  and the second is did  you really performthings the way you planned.<s> Last  but not the least  is  to  check whether the product isconsistent with your  expectation.<s> So to some extent  it  is like a sampling exercise andbased on judgment of the competent people  you would like to see if the QMS has beeneffective or not.<s> So the audits give confidence again  to  both the customer and themanagement.<s> The audit process itself is subject to audit.<p>

Now we ask a question, who should audit?So we can have first party, second party or third party audits.What is the first party audit?First party audit is basically in-house audit perform by people within the organization butnot working on that particular project.<s> It is a defensive action prior to certification of anyparticular commitment that you make.<s> It  ensures that implementation is satisfactory, itserves as a means for  improvement, complies  with the contracted requirements and ingeneral it evaluates any particular quality problem that you may face in the organization.<p>

Second party audits  are  normally performed by the customer.<s> A customer wants you todevelop something for him.<s> He wants a guarantee before he contracts that job to you thatyou will be in a position to do that.<s> On one hand you specify why you are the best personto make that particular product or to enter into that particular project.<p>

Second thing is that the customer would really like to say that do you really work the wayyou say you do.<s> And from that particular point of view the second party audits are oftenperformed  by the customer.<s> And they  may  also play a  very useful role  like vendorselection, when you want to go find a vendor you would like to go and do a second partyaudit on your vendor.<p>
