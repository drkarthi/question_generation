Here is again a diagram of what is the verification model of development.You start of  with the requirements specification in this case.<s> With requirementspecification you can start writing the acceptance test plan because the requirementspecification is done by the customer and the customer is ultimately the one who is goingto accept the system.So the requirement specification will lead to the acceptance test plan, which in turn a leadto actually doing the acceptance test when the software is ready to be acceptance tested.Then the system specification is written,  system specification can also go towards theacceptance test plan,  because in some cases the  user maybe involved the systemspecification,  but more often that it  will take the rights side arrow  (Refer Slide Time:20:33) of this particular box coming down into a system integration test plan.Because once you specify the system as: Here are the four different modules, here is thespecification of the each one of the modules  of  the system,  that  is what the functionalspecification looks like.<s> In that case you have to have some kind of an integration testplan that is built around this specification and design.<p>

And then the detail design  or  the system design and specification together go intocreating the system integration test plan.<s> Because the design is also responsible formodularizing the software, it is responsible for breaking it up to say that, we are going touse these components,  we going to build these modules and the modules themselves orthe components themselves maybe individual units of work  that are put together bydifferent people.Even though they  may  be tested individually, there has  to  be some test that covers thecohesiveness of these different modules.<s> Once they come together, is it clearly fulfillingthe  specification even  though  they  work very  well at unit level?<s> That  is what systemdesign at specifications end up driving the integration test plan.<p>
