So,  project initiation process basically comes out with outputs like first the projectcharter.<s> Second,  it also might bring out a list of constraints these are the factors whichlimit the projects teams options, it will also list all the assumptions that have been madeon the basis on which  the project is going to be implemented  and identification of aproject manager.<s> Please  remember, the  earlier you assign a project manager to thisparticular job  project  the better is  the chance of survival of this particular project;somebody to take ownership of this particular project at the earliest.<s> So this will bring usto the end of project initiation.<s> But project initiation really never gets completed in a truesense unless we do a little bit of a formal tomtom about it, it is called project kick off.<s> So,if you have a formal project kick off  it will get  so much better response from theorganization.<p>

What are the purposes that it will serve?First of all it will introduce the project manager and the team members to each other, itwill also help in creating a team sprit up  front, it also help formulate give an openenvironment an opportunity for pair change of technical issues in the organization aboutthis particular project, to achieve common understanding about the projects requirement,to get a commitment from the team,  to demonstrate the managements backing to theproject;  for instance,  who attends your project kick off  will  really go down in thegrapevine of the organization to say how important this project is to the organization.<p>
