Here we are taking an example of a book supplier.<s> He supplies books to customer.<s> In facthe does  not keep any stocks.<s> As he receives the orders,  these orders are processed andthey are sourced from different publishers and the orders are met.<s> There is some kind ofan agent who receives orders from customers and he fulfills those by directly sourcing thebooks from the publishers.<s> We can start of by preparing a context diagram where theentire order processing is shown as a single process and we identify two importantentities.<s> They are the customer entity and the publisher entity.<s> We also identify importantinputs and outputs from these two entities.<s> We receive an order from a customer and wealso send a shipping note to the customer when we have dispatched the books to him.<s> Theshipping note will tell the customer that the books have been dispatched and in future wewill receive a payment also from the customer.<s> As marked out in the bottom of thediagram, all inputs and outputs are not shown  in the diagram.<s> Only the few are shownhere.<s> But you can indicate all the other details.<s> Similarly when the publisher is shown asan entity, we are showing some important outputs going to him.<p>

The order processing will prepare a purchase order and send it to the publisher.<s> Thepublisher would send us the books and along with the books we will also receive  theshipment details such as what books and in which quantity they are being sent to us etcand naturally we will have to make a payment to the publisher.<s> So this context diagramhere identified  the important entities and important inputs/outputs from these entities.Now,  we will decompose this in more details  and in successive levels.<s> This is the firstrefinement, where we have decomposed the whole application into four processes.<p>
