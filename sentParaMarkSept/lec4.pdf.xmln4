From here we prepare  a  logical data  flow diagram by removing the current implementation-specific details.<s> Basically we want to now focus on the what specification what exactly done andwhat is require to be done rather than how it is being done.<s> So we try to construct the logical dataflow diagram from the physical current data flow diagram.<s> We did also identify the boundary ofautomation.<s> What is the scope for the software system which processes and sub processes wouldbe included in the scope of the software.<s> Once this is done we prepare the data flow diagram forthe proposed system.<p>

In fact the difference between the existing system and proposed system has to be clearly workedout  and this would depend on not only the user requirements but it would benefit from theexperience of the analyst the innovations that he can suggest in the existing processes so that theproposed system will effectively solve the problems which were felt by the user and which hasinitiated the whole project.<p>

So the proposed system is not just a  duplication of the existing systems.<s> We are not onlychanging the way the things are done today but we may even extend the scope of the system wemay suggest new task, new functions, new output from the system.<s> So this would depend on thevision  and the experience of both the users in terms of what they need in order to solve theirbusiness problems effectively and the experience and the vision of the developer or the analystwho is assisting the user in identifying the requirements.<s> So naturally this will include new needsof the users the proposed system would improve the work flows it might do some businessprocess re engineering it will try to introduce efficiency and most effectiveness in the way thingsare done at present.<s> So idea  is to repair the data  flow diagram for the proposed system.<s> Thisproposed system will become the basis for software implementations subsequently and oncethese proposed systems is clearly defined in terms of inputs, processing, outputs.<p>
