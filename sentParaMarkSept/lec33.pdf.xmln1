Let us now continue our  session  on  estimation.<s> In  the earlier section we saw what afunction point is.<s> The function point is the measure of the size of the software product.<s> Toillustrate those some other concepts let us now take an example of marketing[enterprise...1:12].<s> Imagine for the time being there is a marketing organization which hascountrywide operations,  it  has offices in several cities which  are located at differentplaces all over India and each of these  particular regions sells a  wide range of productsthrough several channels.<s> At  the end of the month each of these  regions is supposed tosend a performance report to the head office.<s> And this report is basically a product-wisesale  summary for the month and it is a  means of communication between the regionaloffice and the head office.<s> The report is sent to the head office by different regions bydifferent means ranging from e-mail to hand delivery.<p>

Now at head office we are required to summarize this particular data and also generate adatabase which can be used as a foundation for a limited [decision2:22.<s> ]  supportsystem for the top management in the sense that some kind of an enquiry facility can beprovided on this particular database.<s> So every month the proposed system will update thesales database and generate some fixed number of reports as required and also provide anenquiry facility for the managements use as and when.<s> Hence five reports and an enquiryfacility is the requirement.<p>
