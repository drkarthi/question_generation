For example, when student study a course and let us say  he has course attribute.<s> We can saycourse attribute value is CS 101, which is the course code but that is not the same thing as sayingcourse as a value.<s> When we say that the whole course itself is a value then we say that theattribute in this case is an attribute whose value is another entity, the course entity.<s> In this casewe are creating a complex entity with values as entities themselves.<s> The second example is whenwe create an entity from an  existing set of entities which you may  already  have identified.<s> Soyou club them together and create a more complex entity.<s> We will see an example of the secondcase.<p>

Consider the example of the work order.<s> Work order is something which will be received by acompany or an organization and it is supposed to manufacture that particular item for a givencustomer.<s> When a work order is received, the work order will need to be translated into someraw materials and tools which will be worked upon by the workers to create that particular pieceof product.<s> A work order is primarily represented in terms of three basic entities: the rawmaterials, tools and workers.<s> It is really a complex entity and that complex entity is formed by arelationship between raw material, tool and workers.<p>
