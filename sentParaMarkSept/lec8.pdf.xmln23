Entity relationships simply show a generalized relationship between two kinds of entitiesin an object model.<s> In the case of inheritance relationship it shows the is a relationshipor a specialization generalization relationship.<s> Aggregation shows a part of or wholerelationship.<s> For example house  is composed of;  dinning room,  kitchen room or livingroom and so on.<s> Aggregation models try to show what is composed of what and also canbe a part of interesting data model.<s> Again here is an example of something which is anaggregation model.<s> It shows that there is something called a study pack that can be soldfor example relating to a course.<p>

(Refer Slide Time: 53:56)<p>

A  study pack consists of lecture nodes it,  consists of video tape representations,  itconsists of slides, it consists of assignment and so on.<s> Assignment in this particular caseconsists of exercises, solutions and so on.<s> It is trying to build up the notion of a differentpiece parse and a larger entity which is a course of entity, is the combination of differentpiece parse that can exist.<s> Behavioral models for objects essentially are what are calledmessage sequence charts and we saw an example of this earlier.<s> They show the differenttransitions that can exist in response to external stimuli that occurs in the system.<p>

I am going to quickly draw an example of message sequence charge represented as MSCin this case.<s> We will show an example of the ATM process.<s> Here is an automatic tellermachine.<s> The different entities here are user,  ATM,  may be the security subsystem thatcan exist and so on.<s> The user for example, can end up inserting a card to the ATM.<s> Themessage sequence chart is a sequence of messages that occurs in reaction to this insertcard message that was first sent by the user to the ATM.<s> So the ATM immediately readthe card and then this axis is that of time may read the card may go to a security modulesay verify card.<s> The security may come back and say verified.<s> And the ATM mightnow give choices to user like withdrawal, deposit choices and so on.<p>
