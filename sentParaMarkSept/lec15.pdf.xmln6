Now we are going to look at some examples of structural pattern.<s> Let  us look at the adapterpattern.<s> Adapter is something like you are converting an AC  volt to DC  volt.<s> This is anexample from software domain.<s> You are building a collection class hierarchy  for collectionssuch as FIFO, LIFO etc.<s> FIFO is First In First Out collection set and LIFO is Last In First Outcollection.<s> This is a collection hierarchy and  you may have an abstract class called collectionand then all these are sub classes which you need to implement.<s> Now, you find that there is anexisting class called stack and  it can be used for providing the LIFO collection.<s> How do youadopt the existing class stack to the new interface of the collection classes?<s> This below slideshows our solution.<s> First let us look at the collection class hierarchy.<p>

(Refer Slide Time: 33:33)<p>

You have the  Collection  super class which specifies two member functions called insert ()and fetch().<s> You should be able to insert an item into collection and fetch the items out of thecollection.<s> Now, you want to build a LIFO type of collection and FIFO type of collection andthese specific collection or these concrete collections are going to implement the abstractmember functions declared in the super class or collection.<s> When you are implementing LIFO,you want to use the existing class stack.<s> But you see that it has a different interface on stack.You are calling it as push () or pop () and you want to map it to insert () and fetch ().<s> How doyou achieve this?<p>

You are trying to now look at the intent  of this pattern.<s> We  had described it earlier you areadopting this interface push() and pop() to insert() and fetch(), because the planned applicationhere is going to use this object hierarchy to this specific interface only, that is insert and fetch.The client knows collection, which is of type collection.<s> It might be either FIFO or LIFO andclient application can simply call in certain  fetch.<s> But now since we already have somethingcalled stack with an interface called push and pop, why cannot we simply map push and poponto this insert and fetch.<s> That means that is to adopt one space to another.<s> So the solution isadapter.<p>

Now you must have figured out by this time, how we should be able to do that.<s> In your LIFOclass, you have insert and fetch.<s> For example fetch implementation which has been given canbe simply called pop now if you use multiple inheritance, LIFO inherits from this abstract classcollection and a concrete class stack.<s> And implements  insert by a call to push and fetch by acall to pop.<s> If you use inheritance, you can simply make these calls  as if the functions areavailable on to you locally.<s> The pattern can be described as follows.<s> On the earlier slide we hadthe concrete solution, for an example that was collection hierarchy.<p>
