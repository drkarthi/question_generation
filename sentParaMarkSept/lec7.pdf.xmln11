First we have to make sure that syntactic correctness exists.<s> As long as syntacticcorrectness exists and it is a completely well formed expression, then you have to look atwhether the expressions are meaningful.<s> For example, whether they satisfy thepreconditions, some of the operations result in error.<s> So if there were no errors and if itwas syntactically meaningful expression that was being laid out then the axioms could beuse to prove that expression and that what we mean by the specification that is essentiallycomplete.<s> So what we are trying to look at both structural integrity of the syntacticalcorrectness as well as semantic integrity that needs to be checked for.<s> Query operationsare obviously very important in the whole operation.<p>

There is a definition of sufficient completeness, which is fairly formal we are looking atin the slide: The ADT specification for any given type T is sufficiently complete if andonly if the axioms that have been laid out for that particular ADT make it possible tosolve the following problems in any well formed expression of e: First determine whethere is correct.<s> Given some expression e  and we saw an expression that was the longsequences of pushes and the pops on an empty stack which is evaluated to this value x4.If we can prove that indeed is the case by using reductions,  having used the differentaxioms that are present and we can prove that value is  equal to x4 then it is a validexpression and e is correct.<s> That is what we mean by prove that e is correct.<p>

The second condition that we are holding to in this case is: If e is a query expression, youremember  the different types of expressions that can exist are  command  expression,query expressions and constructor expressions.<s> So if  e  is a query expression and hasshown to be correct under S1 rule that we just laid out, then we should be able to expressthe value of the expression in a way that does not involve the type T itself that is beingtested for completeness.<p>

Although this seems to be a little complex what this is really going to show is fact that ifgiven any expression that can be  formulated out of the language.<s> The language that isgiven to us is a set of operations that are possible in the stack.<s> Replace  Item,  forexample is a new expression that we wrote out using the operations that were given to usearlier.<s> We have to determine whether this expression is correct or wrong that is it issyntactically correct, whether there is structural integrity within this,  that there are noerror conditions that  can exist on this expression and if it is a query expressionparticularly then it can be evaluated into a  form that is  not  involved  in any  moreoperations within the definitions itself.<s> Thats the definition of completeness.<p>
