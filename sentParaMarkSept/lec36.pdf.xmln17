So  it grants explicit freedom to select the order of improvement.<s> Understand  thedifference,  in case of the  staged  model the path is chopped  out  and  in the continuousmodel you can choose your own particular path  that best meets the organizationsbusiness needs.<s> Therefore wherever you think is the major weakness that is the thing.<p>

What  this particular model does is to allow you to have an  achievement  profile to saywhere you are and it also enables you to set a target profile as where you would like to beand  one  is deciding where you are and the  other is deciding where you want to be andthen allows you to set your own particular goals so that the improvements can beachieved in a balanced manner.<s> This particular kind of approach is used in a continuousmodel.<s> Now we ask a simple particular question; what are the other considerations thatgo into the making of the particular model.<s> So the continuous model increases visibilityinto capability of individual process area whereas the stage model increases the visibilitylevel by level.<p>
