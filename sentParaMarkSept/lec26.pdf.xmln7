Hence, typically the need for this is felt by companies where there is dissatisfaction at thehigh level of overhead that is introduced  by  the software development process;  peopleneed the software very quickly and the focus here is more on code rather than the designthe design may not even live very long  because  of  what is called re-factoring and  re-factoring  is the way of changing the design or changing the code to best meet todaysrequirements, meet the requirements of now and not what the requirements are likely tobe in future whereas the objective of a good design is always to meet its future proof, it isa future proof to the system to make sure that any new requirements may come in downthe line and  can  also be accommodated  in the system very easily.<s> Agile  methods areagain in summary are based very much on iterative methods of the software developmentand intended to deliver working software very very quickly.<p>

So  what is the process?<s> For example,  what are some of the principles behind agilemethods or rapid application development?The first principle clearly is that of customer involvement.<s> We have seen that the user iscontinually  involved;  the user has to  be  involved in specifying the system,  in quicklyevaluating the increment that is coming out or  prototype that is coming out,  givingfeedback and so on and so incremental delivery obviously is  another principle of thisprocess and this is a process that very much depends, the methods here, the methodologyvery much depends on the skill level of the people rather than on the process itself.<s> So itis not process base it depends on how good the people are at working very rapidly to turnaround software without appropriate designs, without formal specifications and so on sothese would have to be people who can understand the customers needs by looking at ainitial set of requirements quickly working with the customer to deliver some softwareand the system is inherently designed for change.<p>
