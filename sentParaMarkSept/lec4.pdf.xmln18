So functionally it should be acceptable to the user.<s> Moreover  it should also be acceptable interms of performance.<s> In a SRS document the performance criteria were also specified.<s> So at thispoint the SRS document will be used by the user to carry out the final acceptance of the system.Once the user has accepted the system we are ready to switch over.<s> The system can be installed.And once the system is installed we are ready to use the software in day-to-day operations.<s> Thenext phase which is the operations and maintenance phase, we will ensure that the system willcontinue to meet the user needs.<s> And in order to do this we may have to take up maintenanceactivities.<s> The maintenance activity consists of, removing any errors that the user may find in thesoftware, or extending the present features in the software for new requirements that the usermay have.<s> So we might make some extensions or we may even add entirely new features.<p>

Occasionally it may also be necessary to convert the software to run on new platforms or newsystems, because the software might have a fairly long life and during this time the hardware orthe systems may change significantly and we may want to change the platform of the software.So these are the maintenance activities and this generally continues throughout the lifecycle.<p>

Let us summarize the various phases we have carried out.<s> We have seen that there are differentphases and each phase has a well-defined task and has a well-defined deliverables.<s> In many casesthese deliverables have  a  standard format.<s> Now we have seen that feasibility was one of theimportant steps.<s> It establishes different alternatives  and these alternatives  are  analyzed for thecost effectiveness.<s> Requirement analysis is a  very important  step  and  also very challengingwhere the analyst or the developer has to prepare the complete specifications for the software bymeeting the users and by going through the existing system if necessary.<s> So this is going to bethe first baseline.<s> And we saw  that there is an IEEE format which is very comprehensive andwhich defines the various aspects of the software which needs to be developed.<p>
