So,  you have these three different cases and S1  is  the  branching statement  or thebranching predicate,  from where you find out what the choice is and then branch toappropriate nodes and then you join at S5.<s> S5 is your serve (drink) or it is actually thetermination of switch loop and I have combined the serve drink with that, because it isin sequential composition.<s> Hence, you need not have to point out all the nodes.<s> So S5 canbe your serve drink, which is the end of your switch statement.<s> If you want to cover allthe statements, these are the basic paths S1 S2 S5, S1 S3 S5 and S1 S4 S5.<s> So this is flowgraph for a specific switch statement.<s> Now, we will look at a compound condition.<s> In thisexample, we can see that we have a compound condition.<p>

We are looking at two values and we want to execute x, if a or b is true.<s> So, if a istrue we will execute x or if b is true then also we will execute x, if both of them are truethen we will execute x, else otherwise something else will be done.<s> So if a and b bothare false,  then something else  will be done.<s> This is  the flow graph for this compoundcondition.<s> Here the S1 will check for a and if a is true, we execute x and then join atthe end of the conditional branching statement.<s> The last node is the joint part of thiscompound conditional statement.<p>
