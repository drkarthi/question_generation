Abstraction focuses on what instead of the how.<s> What: is the process of analysis, theprocess specifying the interface of a module.<s> How: is the process of design where youspecify, how  you build that functionality when the module is exported to the rest of theworld.<s> Why the abstraction is useful in producing quality software is something that wehave to be convinced about before we move forward.<s> One of the things of separatingimplementation from interface is that safeguards against implementation variations.<s> Whatthis means is that you can essentially change the implementation of something withoutaffecting the clients that use that particular module.<s> A  good example is famous or nowthe in-famous Y2K bug that existed.What happened there in that case was not the criticality was not caused by the fact thatthe representation of the date simply had two digits to represent the year instead of four.But that  was not the heart of the problem.<s> The heart of the problem was lack ofabstraction in that internal implementation of the date which was exposed through out thesoftware and they did not use an abstract interface to a date.<s> As result of which when achange has to be made to the structure of that  date module,  it had to be changed andwritten in millions of places which have now  used this particular internal structuredirectly without an abstract interface to it.<p>

Therefore the separation of interface from implementation or separating the essence fromdetail is very critical.<s> Another example can be that you can construct a stack as a list or asan array and it does not matter to the user of the stack on how you end up the building thestack.<s> What he cares about is the operations that the stack supports.The operations such as pushing, the popping, the top of the stack, creating and deleting astack etc is that what he cares about.<s> As long as you implement it, using an array or a listor whatever else it does not matter to the user of the stack.<p>

It also promotes reuse.<s> Abstraction will basically allow you to say a car  has  everythingthat of a vehicles.<s> But it may have certain specific characteristic such as four wheels.<s> Thetruck is also a vehicle,  but it may have 8  or  10  wheels or 12  wheels.<s> This notion ofreusing whatever definition has been done up to date.<s> But now extending it goes a longways towards promoting reuse as well.<s> It is important to try and figure out as to how weget the process of abstraction right and the three key quality characteristics that we haveto look at in order to ensure that the abstractions we have come up with are just right.<p>

First one is be precise,  so  there  needs to be some formal way of putting down theproperties of abstraction that we are trying or to write down or properties of the modulethat we are trying to write down.<s> The second thing is that it should be complete.<s> It willnot be reused unless it is complete.<s> It has all the facets that are attached to it that could beused by various people.<s> The third thing is that you do not have to go over board.<s> Youshould not over specify,  else  the  understandability feature is going to get seriouslyaffected.<s> If  there are too  many details that are coming out, it is  not the essence of thatobject.<s> There are different abstraction techniques.<s> In fact if you take a look at this list,encapsulation, information hiding, polymorphism, inheritance, genericity and so on.<p>
