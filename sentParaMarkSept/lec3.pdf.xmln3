So we start by studying the existing system, we understand the sub processes; we try tofind out what is done and where and how it is being done.<s> So the beginning point is theexisting system.<s> From here the data flow diagram that we produce naturally correspondsto the current system and corresponds to the physical view of what is happening  in thereal world.<s> So we call it physical current data flow diagram.<s> From here we prepare alogical data flow diagram by removing the current implementation specific details.Basically we want to now focus on what  specification, what exactly is done,  or what isrequired to be done rather than how is being done.<s> So we try to construct the logical dataflow diagram from the physical current data flow diagram.<s> We then also identify theboundary of automation; what is the scope for the software system?<s> Which processes andsub processes would be included in the scope of the software?<s> Once this is done, then weprepare the data flow diagram for the proposed system.<p>
