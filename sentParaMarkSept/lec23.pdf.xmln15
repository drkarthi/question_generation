So what we really need to look at is the economic feasibility and work out whether thetwo options that we have,  which one of them is more cost effective  and whether it isworthwhile  to take up this project at all or we can find better ways of spending thismoney  7  lakh or 10  lakh whatever the alternative implies.<s> So  economic feasibility willestablish how good is the investment, whether the project is worth doing and what kind ofbenefits we can look forward to in each of these alternatives.<s> So before working that out,we may ask ourselves have we given enough number of alternatives.<s> Are there low cost,medium cost, high cost kind of alternatives given to the user.<p>

Now  there can be a low cost solution which can completely avoid computerization.<s> Itmight reexamine the kind of record keeping and the cards system that we are using andmight replace it by something else.<s> We have noted earlier the partial computerization isnot possible.<s> So  a low cost solution might be considered.<s> The  medium cost solution iswhat we have discussed earlier,  the two solutions fall in this category and we can alsothink of some high cost solution.<s> We can also think of buying a product which might beavailable in the market which may do something more than circulation.<s> It  might eventake care of book acquisition  system.<s> So  we can look at different range but in thisparticular exercise, in this case study let us look at the two alternatives that we saw andanalyze them.<p>

So let us consider the financial analysis for the first alternative which has the initial costof 7 lakhs rupees.<s> Now what are the benefits?<s> Can we quantify them?<s> With quantificationwe will be able to establish whether it is a beneficial investment or not.<s> So here we havetried to work out the benefits.<s> So we say that with this automation, we will be able to saveon salaries of four people  because we will not need so many people at the counter andthose trays will not be required where the cards have to be sorted and cards have to bepulled out.<s> So out of 7 people we can reduce 4 people giving us the saving of 1.92 lakhs.<p>
