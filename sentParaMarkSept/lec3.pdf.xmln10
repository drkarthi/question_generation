We then prepare the design document and which is then reviewed both by technicalpeople as well as the management people.<s> The technical people who review the documentwould  ensure that different technological options considered  are  meaningful under allimportant or all applicable options have been covered.<s> Whereas the management reviewwould be concerned with identifying whether there are implications on cost, benefits andso on.<s> The purpose of the review is to ensure that we are within the proposed costs andwe will be able to meet the schedules.<s> The technical review would ensure that there areno errors in the proposed design, that it is consistent and complete and various applicablealternatives have been worked out.<s> This phase should end with a clear choice.<s> So thedifferent alternatives prepared in terms of different system designs are reviewed both bythe management and the users, and it ends with a clear choice which can be taken furtherinto detailed design and implementation.<p>

What are the design goals in this phase?<s> In this phase we are trying to define or do adesign of the processing component, because the requirements are clearly defined in theprocessing needs of the user.<s> So  these processing components  will be converted intosoftware.<s> We have a functional approach as well as we have an object oriented approach.Different alternatives are available for design methodologies.<s> They may be conventionalfunctional development or it could be object oriented development.<s> There are differentmethodologies available for the paradigms.So if it is a functional paradigm you may use structured system  analysis and designmethodology,  which is based on taking data flow diagrams and converting them intosoftware architecture.<s> Taking entity relationship diagrams and converting them intodatabase design.<s> Or it could be  an  object oriented paradigm and the associated objectoriented methodology in which you convert it into an object oriented implementation.<s> Sothe kind of design methodology you choose would depend on the paradigm that you wantto employ for implementing the software.<s> If you are designing the functional componentsseparately you also need to design the data component.<s> The data component is generallyhandled by designing a database for the given application.<s> A database design consists ofmultiple steps.<p>
