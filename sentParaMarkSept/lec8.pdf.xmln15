Once you set the timer you still have to provide a start event necessarily that would be asensible way to set it up on the microwave.<s> The start event in this case would essentiallyindicate the microwave has to start operation, then there can be a cancel event and therecan be a timer done event etc.<s> Here notice that there can be external stimuli as well asinternal stimuli.<s> The external stimuli  are things like start,  cancel,  half power,  and fullpower and so on.<s> The internal stimuli could be  things  like door is open,  door is closedand is been disabled, is been powered on and off etc.<s> So there can be different stimulus aswell.<s> This diagram primarily indicate what the microwave operation looks like and this iskind of similar to a state transition diagram,  except that it  is  kind of very muchoperational in nature.<p>

What this is trying to illustrate is that, when you set it to cook you set the time you cookits going to run description in an operational diagram of what are the different tasks thatare done by each one of the steps in the microwave.<s> So there is a cook module and thecook module has a single function on it which is run and when it runs it basically turnsthe generator on  when it cooks.<s> When it is done there has to be a certain action.Whenever it goes into a done  state you have to turn the buzzer on.<s> Typically themicrowaves have some kind of  a beeping mechanism which let you know that theoperation is done.<p>

This operational diagram is very much like a state transition diagram except that it isaugmented and these are not states, these are functions which actually let you know whatexactly is going to be done in this case.<s> It is not the transition of the internal state that ishappening but it is kind of lets us know that these are the different functions to be done.For example if something went wrong with the microwave then there could be somethinglike an alarm function or alarm module within the microwave.<s> And it would kind of emitor beep or it might display something like this is gone wrong with the microwave so on.<p>
