You  have to make sure that you keep a sustainable pace  of development;  it  is notsomething that XP in fact actively discourages people from working very very longhours  so  the standard notion of overtime does not exist in  this kind  of a model so youhave to keep a sustainable pace of development and not something that goes very high fora period of time and then drops drastically after that.<s> It also demands an onsite customerinvolvement so there needs to be somebody who pretty must stays with the developmentteam on a continual basis; it is not something that can be thrown out to the ward of thecustomer say you take a look at it and  come back;  the customer is often involve d indevelopment as well to some extent.<p>

So the agile principles are pretty obvious.<s> XP is clearly a way of doing agile developmentas well and we have seen that the focus is on people here and  not processes,  change  issupported because of the regular system releases that are already built in and so on andcustomer involvement is pretty continuous.<p>

So,  requirement scenarios in XP  are basically called stories.<s> Let  us take a brief look athow XP  functions internally  and these stories are basically written on cards and thedevelopment team breaks each story that they pick for that increment down into a set ofimplementation tasks.<s> There may not be an overall design;  certainly there may be somearchitecture that the team adheres  to.<s> So,  for example,  this is a  service orientedarchitecture that you are going to use, this is the pipes and filter architecture that we aregoing to use and that decision may be made very early in the life cycle of the entiresoftware project or may be even before the first increment is done but going beyond therethere is no emphasis on  designing individual  modules  by themselves so the tasks  arebasically implementation tasks  and these are the basis of creating the schedule  and thecost estimate.<s> So only after you have broken them into tasks and since you are doing it ona very small scale you can then say this iteration is going to cost x, there is no cost for theentire project it is very hard to determine them because you have not planned out all theiterations ahead of time and these are done as you go long.<s> So the customers are the onesthat end up choosing the stories for inclusion of a particular increment and that was thento drive the cost for increment and so on.<p>
