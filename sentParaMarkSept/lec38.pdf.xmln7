Some risky events that occur during the early stages of a project can also be dealt with byclarifying the requirements, obtaining the information, improving the communication etc.So  what you basically try to do is do everything and the risk itself will get eliminated.Therefore reducing the scope of the project to avoid high risk activities, adding resourcesor time, adopting familiar approach rather than innovative approach, avoiding unfamiliarsub contractor or de-allocating a specific team member are some of the defensive actionsthat we have.<s> It is not possible to have all project risks but some specific project risks canbe avoided by planning in this particular manner.<p>

The next approach is transfer the risk.<s> This is very akin to taking an insurance policy sowe are trying to transfer your risk from yourself to the insurer.<s> This involves transferringthe risk to minimize this impact and shifting the consequence of the risk to the third partytogether with the ownership of the response.<s> So  this transfers  the responsibility for therisk and does  not eliminate the risk itself.<s> Understand  the difference between theavoidance and this particular strategy.<p>

The  risk persist but is not eliminated that  is transferred.<s> Suppose  the  hospital had  aproblem with retaining systems managers they could always think in terms of contractingthe job out to a very large company like Tata Consultancy Services so that what happensis that possibility of people leaving still continues but this  consequence  or  the dealingwith that particular situation is transferred to the agent.<s> Obviously  it  costs  money  to dothis particular thing.<s> Therefore particularly this is the most appropriate form of responseto financial risks.<s> If you  have entered  into a penalty clause  in the event of failures orconsequential cause because of your software people always get yourself being insuredagainst it.<p>
