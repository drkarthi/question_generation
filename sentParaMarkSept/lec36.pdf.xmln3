So,  if you were to look at a matured process  for instance  it is consistent with the  waywork gets done like what you say and what you do is similar, it is well defined, it is wellunderstood and it is used in a consistent manner throughout the organization.<s> So it allowspeople to fully exploit their potential for developing the particular product.<s> But not onlythat, it is also amenable to improvement.<s> So once you have a document at process we canthink of improving it in an  on-going basis.<s> Therefore  process maturity is basicallysomething that is a measurable indicator of the process quality.<s> A process maturity is ameasurable indicator of the process quality.<p>

Now  we look at the next particular thing.<s> What  we  mean by a maturity level.<s> Again  ifyou look at the slide the main objective behind defining the maturity level is to achieve acontrol and a measured process as a foundation for continuing improvement.<p>

(Refer Slide Time: 05:08)<p>

Let us understand this in a little more detail now.<s> First, the levels that we define must bereasonably realistic in the sense that they must represent the actual historical phases ofevolution and of course the improvements that are followed in an organization not oneorganization  but  in a group of organizations.<s> They  must also represent a measure ofimprovement that is reasonable to achieve from the prior level to the next level.<s> It is likeindicating that there being multiple steps to go from one level to another and the other iseach particular step being realistic enough to be climbed.<p>

So  once we have done that we  say that maturity structure is intended for use with aspecific assessment methodology  and a management system.<s> What  it means is ourorganization  should be in  a position to  do a self assessment about the current maturitystatus.<s> And obviously once you got the current maturity status you will think in terms ofimprovement.<s> So  it should provide a structure for prioritizing the improvements in theorganizational context.<s> So, if you have a concept of this particular maturity levels then weare going to be using this particular data for a variety of reasons.<p>
