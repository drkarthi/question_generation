The theorem is going to be a pretty simple one.<s> The first thing is that the book that is onloan  cannot  be requested.<s> The book is not even in the library at that point in  time andtherefore the book that is on loan cannot be requested.<s> To put it down formally what weare interested in proving is that, if it is on loan that isL, then it cannot be requested whichisNOT of Q[LQ ].And this will help us check whether the specification matchesour understanding of the software and vice versa.<s> The approach that we will take in thisparticular case is proof by contradiction approach.<s> The proof by contradiction is that westart out by making one assumption, that this statement is false is the assumption that wewill make in this particular case.<s> And then will derive a contradiction through successiverefinement and steps that we shall see shortly.<p>

Having derived contradiction since it is pretty clear that only one assumption was madethe  assumption must have been false.<s> because this come up among contradictiontherefore the statement must be true in the first place and it cant be false at all so that isthe approach that will take and Let us go down the set of steps that would now require forthis.<s> If we have to prove that L implies NOT Q.<s> So we will start of by assuming  thenegation.<s> We have to assume NOT of L implies NOT Q.<s> ()LQ    AssumeNegation - This is the first step.<s> As soon as this is done, we will start refining what wehave just written out.By rewriting this implication we can say that this automatically leads to NOT of NOT LOR NOT Q instead of NOT of L implies NOT Q.<s> ()LQ   Rewriting  By DeMorgans law this can simply be written as L AND Q.LQ De Morgans Law Bysimplifying L AND Q we simply end up in L in this case.<s> L  Simplifying Remember,the first set of notations that we had L AND NOT of S OR R.  Because of that,  byconditional,  L will simply end up implying NOT of S OR R.()SR By  conditionalthat we had was, L double implies of NOT of S OR R()LSR  Continuing on, theNOT of S OR R implies Q by simplification()SR =&gt; QQ however implies S OR R.=&gt;SRThis was one of the original definitions that we had.<s> The fact that a book isrequested implies that it is either on the stacks or on reserve.<s> This implication is done bythe definition that we did earlier.<p>
