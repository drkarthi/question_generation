Now what are we doing at level 2?Basically  at level two we are a little disciplined organization.<s> The policies exist formanaging the project, some kind of planning takes place though it may be largely basedon experience,  successful practices are largely repeatable,  processes  are implementedthough all projects in the company may not follow the same processes but the projects dodefine the processes before starting the project, the commitments that we make in termsof cost, schedule and quality are realistic enough so we do this and better track all thesethings, the cost schedule and quality are tracked so that we are always going as planned.Requirements and work products are base line.<p>

Standards  are defined and they are confirmed to and  a strong customer supplierrelationship exists  and measurement process basically  is in place.<s> So  the concept ofplanning,  executing,  measuring,  getting a feedback from the measurements andimprovement are the catch particular words.<s> Now once we are at level 2 what we need todo is to go to level 3.<s> So again if you look at the slide what do we do in level 3?<p>

In  level three what we are trying to do is to have web  possible organization-widestandards.<s> So we are basically using our lessons that we have learnt and based on that weestablish  standards and we provide an input both for planning and for evaluation of theproject.<s> So, at the define level or at the standards and the consistency level that we havethe organization has standard processes which are used across the organization by almostall the projects.<p>

Effective engineering practices are also there,  the integration of engineering processesand the management processes is well done, the reuse of organizational learning like wesay err, err and err but less, less and less so that even if you have to make a mistake makesure that you learn from the mistake and do not repeat the same mistake again.<s> Then youhave  separate processing engineering  groups which concentrate  only on improving theprocesses, and learn from the past experience and improves the processes.<p>
