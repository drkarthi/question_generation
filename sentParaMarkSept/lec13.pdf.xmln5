Efficiency refers to the usage of resources.<s> For example, when I run this software, I haveto think about whether I need a main frame to  run it or a smaller box with  one or twoCPUs should be enough.<s> And I should see whether it needs memory hog or 256 MB ofmemory would be enough.<s> I should also consider I  by O,  bandwidth etc.<s> All feature orresources that have  to be carefully  conserved and  managed  and the  software  should beefficient in dealing with it.<s> The  integrate-ability factor is basically refers to compliancewith standards.<s> For example, if my financial or accounting system has been bought fromone vendor and my inventory management system has been bought  from a secondvendor, will these two talk to each other?Every time I loose inventory for example I have to record it as lost inventory within thefinancial system that I have.<s> Basically  I  should be able to automate this transaction, Ishould be able to pass this data  from  one software  to  another,  and I  should be  able tocontrol from one software to another.<s> This is what integrate-ability of the software refersto.<s> This is driven by compliance standard.<s> If both of them work on a common standard,then integration would  be  a  piece  of cake.<s> Otherwise it is going to be very hard and itwould be taking out lot of time and resources.<s> Then there are certain user perceivablefactors like we talked about before: Ease of use.<s> Basically how well have you understoodyour user?<s> How easy is it to install the software?<p>

The Ease of use is not just a functional ease of use that we are talking about, but the nonfunctional aspects of it.<s> If  it is going to take you two days, if it is going to require anexpert system administrator to come in and  install the software for you then  it  is notgoing to go out very well in certain situations.<s> If it is a very complex piece or server sidesoftware it may be acceptable that  the  installation needs an expert.<s> But if it is simpledesktop software like word processor then it should be self installable completely.<p>

Ease of use also means that, how well the software supports  operation such asmonitoring, deployment, redeployment, bringing it down, versioning etc.<s> Another qualityfactor is performance.<s> There are certain performance guide lines or performancerequirements that would have been laid out at the beginning of the process and how welldoes the software conform to these performance  requirements, response times, throughputs etc.<s> But certainly you do not have to worry about performance unless you meet thecorrectness criteria.<s> The first two criteria that we have laid out which is correctness androbustness are absolutely key quality factors that we have to focus on.<s> The question thatwe tend to ask ourselves is, we have looked at all these quality factors that affect softwarebut, what are the keys to achieve the structural quality?What is it that we can do in design?<s> What is that we can do in our process that will helpus produce quality software?<s> The above questions will be the focus of todays lecture.<p>
