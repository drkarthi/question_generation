There are different kinds of models and we are going to get into the details of some ofthose models.<s> But primarily this lecture is to serve as a high level introduction to thedifferent kinds of models and we will get into details of each one of these during thediscussion of the phases of the software engineering life cycles.<s> What  is systemsmodeling  and why is it required is the question that we would ask ourselves in thebeginning.<s> The systems models,  just as the way the formal specifications can andrequirements engineering documents can,  will help the analyst to understand therequirements of the system, the functionality of the system that therefore has to be builtbased on this requirements.<s> And then the models can also be used to communicate withthe different customers.<p>
