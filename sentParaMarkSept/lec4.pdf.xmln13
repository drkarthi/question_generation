So modules should be independent.<s> They should have minimum interdependence.<s> Thesecharacteristics  are important from the maintenance point of view.<s> This is a  basis for  handlingcomplex tasks.<s> Complex tasks must be broken into sub units.<s> These sub units must be cohesive.They should have little interference from other modules.<s> There should be minimuminterdependences, so that a module can be replaced by an equivalent module without disturbingthe overall functioning, and this replacement may be done for various reasons during themaintenance.<s> We decompose the modules or subsystems until we reach units which areimplementable, which can be coded and tested.<s> The software architecture that we tried to definein terms of modules and interrelationships among them can be captured through a notation or adiagramming tool called structure chart.<s> Structure chart is used in functional methodology.It depicts different modules and their calling relationships.<s> There are techniques available toarrive  at such a  design consisting of modules and calls  among them and produce a  structurechart.<s> There  are techniques available to go from data  flow diagrams to structure charts.<s> Astructure chart basically is a hierarchical chart.<s> The modules can be organized at different levels.So that module at level I calls the modules at level I plus 1.<s> A  hierarchically structured set ofmodules, have modules organized at different levels and the control flow is not shown, only thecalling relationships is shown.<s> Here we are putting some kind of a  discipline in the softwarearchitecture that we are designing.<s> The architecture will have  a  hierarchical structure, andmodules at one level will call modules only at the next level and there will not be arbitrary callsamong the modules.<s> This ensures a  systematic  architecture for the software  and is a  veryimportant design guideline.<s> Here is a diagram which shows an example for structured chart.<p>

As you see, we have Task one which is shown as  a  module  at the top.<s> This task has beenwritten  as  a  software module or a  unit.<s> It calls on three modules at the next level.<s> These threemodules have been named as, get input, processing and produce output.<s> The lines whichare connecting these modules basically represent the call that the module Task 1 makes to getinput or processing in order to perform its own job.<s> So the structure chart basically showsmodules as rectangles and links among them representing the call relationships.<s> These modulescall each other to perform their own overall tasks.<s> As you see here the Task 1 invokes the getinput module.<p>
