We will not go into the details of the back end of the business process that this ends updealing with.<s> But what this is trying to illustrate is the different pieces of data flow thatoccurs within the system and I have marked these with little arrows here.<s> But what this istrying to show is initially the order details were gotten, the order details were convertedby this complete order step into a completed order form.<s> The completed order form isagain transformed or converted by this approval step to a signed order form.<s> So this is anexample of a DFD that can illustrate the purpose of creating a data flow diagram in thefirst place.<p>

We can take a look at another very quick example of DFD  that also shows someinteractions with external systems or external stimuli.<s> This is a blood sugar meter system.Here the input to such a system is typically a drop of blood and which is being analyzedfor amount of sugar in the blood.<s> This  is fed to some kind of a sensor.<s> And what thesensor does is,  it does perform  a step of analysis,  typically  some form of chemicalanalysis is done.<s> Before the analysis is done typically the parameters are fed into theanalysis system.<s> The sensor outputs certain set of parameters saying, here is a chemicalcomposition of the blood that I  am seeing  and  here is a different parameters that I  amnoticing.<p>

The analysis will then translate all those parameters into a blood sugar level whichnormally expressed as parts per million or something like that.<s> This can then be, forexample fed into external system that does say insulin computation.<s> How much of insulinwill be required in order to control the blood sugar.<s> Because we know what the normallevels are like.<s> So Insulin computation takes the input the blood sugar level that iscurrently read from the patient and then it outputs amount of insulin to release.<s> Thisamount of insulin to release is fed into some kind of an insulin pump which is really aninsulin device which releases a certain amount of insulin and so on.<p>
