Training programs need to be organized on an organizational basis so that all the peopleunderstand the same process the way it is documented and practices exactly the sameparticular way.<s> So, defining a process by itself is not enough unless people are trained touse  that particular process.<s> This indicates that at level 3  basically you have a goodmanagement insight into the technical process that the project is making.<p>

Obviously  once you are at defined level it does  not make sense to stay at the  definedlevel.<s> What you need to really do is to ensure that you do adhere to that defined standardsand the procedures or  whatever  things you have defined.<s> Again  if you have to go  fromlevel 3 to level 4 what will we do?<p>

Look  at the slide  again.<s> What  we are doing now is we have  started  using our  pastexperience to predict the  outcomes.<s> So one is to plan,  other is to predict.<s> Of course theplanning has to be done based on prediction in the sense that we basically have to see thatare we in a position to really sort of achieve the level that we are aiming or the productsand the performance and the other measurements that we will be taking that  will theyreally give you the kind of results that you are looking for.<p>

We said quantatory goals so we have a fair idea about what we are expecting and basedon  that we plan  and  provide resources.<s> Therefore  quantitative goals are provided forprojects and the processes.<s> The variations are measured not only at the product level butalso at the process performance level.<s> In  course of time you want  the processperformance to narrow down to a standard kind of a performance.<p>
