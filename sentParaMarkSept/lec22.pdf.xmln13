Then it is typically going to  have  to test every single requirement,  so there  needs to besome kind of requirement traceability.<s> Let  us say as; here is the test that  tests therequirement 1.2, here is the test that tests the requirement 1.3 and so on.Because, at the end of the day, you have to have confidence at every user requirement hasbeen tested and works.<p>

So, what are the different items that are being tested?<s> What is the testing schedule?<s> - isone thing that it puts together.If there are 450 tests  that  need to be done because there are 450  requirements  and eachtest kind of breaks down into 10 other sub tests, then what is the schedule?All these are going to take time and going to take resources.<s> Now, what is the plan goingto look like?<s> What are the recording procedures?<s> It is not just sufficient to do the tests,but you have to record the results from a test in a very systematic fashion, so that you cango back and analyze the results  at a later point in  time.<s> So,  what is the recordingprocedure going to look like, what exactly in fact the template of the test results is goingto look like, is very important to specify upfront.<p>

And then what are  the hardware and software requirements  for testing?<s> Do I need justone server?<s> Am I  going to simulate the system or I need a bank  of servers,  because  Iwanted  to run the real system on here?<s> Is there a software test  harness  that is requiredetc?<s> Or there any constraint from the testing  for example, you  cannot test a  particularrequirement because  it  is testing let  us say the degree of user friendliness.<s> It  is a verysubjective kind of a  requirement and maybe it  is something that cannot be testedobjectively.<p>
