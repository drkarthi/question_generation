We will assume that we have already done the context diagram and we are nowdecomposing that first level context diagram or  the zero level DFD into the first levelDFD where we are shown five sub processes.<s> We have numbered them as 1,2,3,4 and 5.We have identified employee as the external entity and while doing the first level DFD,we have identified a few data stores.<s> If you look at the data stores and what the data theycontain,  it will be clearly understood that such data would be required for a payrollapplication.<p>

We have a data store which contains  the data about the employees.<s> Another  data storewhich gives  details of taxation,  tax rules that are applicable.<s> And the third data storewhich contain the payments which have been made to the employee.<s> Let us now look atthe  sub processes.<s> We have employee who supplies data which indicates his workinghours or working days.<s> We indicate that through the data called time card.<s> Time cardgoes from employee to the validation process.<s> The validation process would send thisdata to a process called calculate pay.<s> The calculate pay may refer to tax tables  and itproduces the payment output.<s> The payment output is send to two processes.<p>

The first one goes to process 5, whose responsibility is to print the pay cheque.<s> So chequeis printed and details of payment are stored as well as the physical cheque is handed overto the employee.<s> The  second one goes to  the  process 4.<s> This process  is supposed  toupdate the year to day kind of a data.<s> So the employee data here will also contain therecords of all gross salaries which have been paid to the employee in whole year.<s> It willkeep accumulating the payments as well as the deductions which  we have made.<s> Theprocess is called  update YTD, where YTD stands for Year to Date.<s> These are theemployee details relating to payments which this process will update.<p>
