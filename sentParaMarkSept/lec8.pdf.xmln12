The state system is transitioning from one state to the other in response to the event thatis occurring which is coming in as  arc to that particular state.<s> It  is also expressed innotation called UML and we  will go into a little bit of UML later in this talk.<s> Statetransition diagrams can often be complemented by tables that describe all the states in thestimuli.<s> It can be a more detailed description as supposed to be a formal concise notationas well.<s> We will take a look at another example of a microwave oven model in this casewe will take a simplistic model.<s> We will not go too far into this.<p>

This is a state transition diagram and in the case of microwave oven it can be in severaldifferent states.<s> The microwave can be in four different states it can be waiting, it can beenabled, it can be disabled or it can be running or operating.<s> We can certainly make thisas detailed as we wanted.<s> But we are going to take a fairly simplistic example.<s> The initialstate of the microwave is typically the disabled state.<s> It is powered off or disabled due tosafety reasons.<s> From the disabled state, an event such as an enable event will move it tothe enabled state.<s> That  is what this is trying to show that these are different states.<s> Thenodes are the states.<s> The arcs between them illustrate the events  to which it ends upresponding.<s> Similarly from an enabled state it can go back to a disabled state with adisable event.<p>
