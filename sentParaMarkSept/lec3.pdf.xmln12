So module is a building block and the different modules are interrelated in terms ofexecution.<s> A  module may invoke another module and pass certain data to this moduleand expect certain computations.<s> For example,  a module may solve the data in anascending order or it may compute the tax for a given employee.<s> Now this moduleexpects certain data to be given as input and it produces results.<s> Such a module will becalled from another  module.<s> So we are now talking about the execution architecture ofgiven software which is defined in terms of the modules and the calls that they make oneach other.<s> Now these modules are important elements as we just now said that these arethe building blocks.<s> Good  software architecture should make these modules asindependent as possible.<s> An independent module is one which has a clear responsibility,which has a well defined task to do.<s> It does its function, which  is a cohesive kind of afunction.<p>

So modules should be independent.<s> They should have minimum interdependence.<s> Thesecharacteristics are important from the maintenance point of view.<s> This is a basis forhandling complex tasks.<s> Complex tasks must be broken into sub units.<s> These sub unitsmust be cohesive.<s> They should have little interference from other modules.<s> There shouldbe minimum interdependences, so that a module can be replaced by an equivalent modulewithout disturbing the overall functioning, and this replacement may be done for variousreasons during the maintenance.<p>

We decompose the modules or subsystems until we reach units which are implementable,which can be coded and tested.<s> The software architecture that we tried to define in termsof modules and interrelationships among them can be captured through a notation or adiagramming tool called structure chart.<s> Structure chart is used in functionalmethodology.<s> It depicts different modules and their calling relationships.<s> There aretechniques available to arrive at such a design consisting of modules and calls amongthem and produce a structure chart.There are techniques available to go from data flow diagrams to structure charts.<s> Astructure chart basically is a hierarchical chart.<s> The modules can be organized at differentlevels.<s> So that module at level I calls the modules at level I plus  1.<s> A  hierarchicallystructured set of modules, have modules organized at different levels and the control flowis not shown, only the calling relationships is shown.<p>
