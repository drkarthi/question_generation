So, just to summarize the different benefits that we can get use that we can get of reusingat various levels it does not have to be at any one level; the first one is obviously that ofincreased reliability that the component, the function, the system whatever it is that youare reusing has not only been thoroughly tested because that has been the specializationof the person who has written that component but it is also been used in other situationsbefore  in production situations  and it has stood the test of actual systems.<s> So,  thatincreases reliability that has got out of reusing components and is something that is hardto beat.<p>

Also,  there is a reduced  process risk and this kind of goes  along with the accelerateddevelopment bullet that you see on this particular slide.<p>

The process risk is that it takes away some of the uncertainty because you may not knowfor example how long it is going to take to develop a particular say user interfaces todevelop a particular engine to do something.<s> So, for example, it may be an ERP systemthat you are developing and you need a database design for the ERP system to store a setof to store a set of data.<s> But if the database schema is already available and can beentirely reused from another ERP like project that was being done before then you willyou know that at that amount of time you do not have to budge it into your process and ittakes a risk of estimating the software development effort, it brings it down significantlyand at the same time it accelerates development so that is also a process related benefitthat you get out of reuse because you can proceed much faster; there the thing is that youdo not have to do by hand that are already available, you may have to verify that indeeddoes what is it that you wanted to do.<s> Those are some of the conditions as we can see toreusing components.<p>
