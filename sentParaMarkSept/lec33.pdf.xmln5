Now if you assume that the cost of team is, let us make an assumption that we like a teamof  2  that is 1 plus  1  is equal to  2  and one a little senior and one a little  junior  so  ouraverage cost of man power is 1000 per day.<s> Then we can calculate the cost of the systemdevelopment effort as follows.<s> Therefore development is equal to 68 into 1000 is equal to68000.<s> Now you can add the other components that are associated with the developmentof the system.<s> User  training  for  5  days is that much and support is so much  anddocumentation,  some extra copies that the client require is  so much  etc.<s> And this totalyou need to add of course some continuance and profit.<p>

In  many cases profit  is not shown explicitly and the profit figures are added in thedevelopment cost itself, it is a hidden kind of a number.<s> But just for simplicity we haveshown this particular kind of a figure, if you take the total then you can say that we couldquote to  our client 1,07,800  or approximately  some kind of a number as the totaldevelopment effort for developing this particular kind of a system.<s> Now we can sum upour function point topic,  what are the main advantages  of function point approach tosoftware sizing?The first and the most useful one is that FPA  approach can  be used during very earlystages of development when the information available to the developer is very little.<p>

Second the evaluation effort is very small about  1%  of the total development cost.<s> Themethod is very simple, fairly accurate, easy to learn, it is very easy to explain this to theusers and get a conformation about the functions from the user so the users can easily tellyou what is the EI and what is the EO,  EQ and ILF and EIF etc.<s> So this facilitatesverification and last but not the least the method being so simple it does not required useof any software tools.<p>
