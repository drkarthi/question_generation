We  will  study  them in more details subsequently but basically the idea  here in the functionaldecomposition is that the overall functionality of the software system we plan to develop isbroken down into subtasks.<s> For example in a railway reservations system we may have one subfunction called reservations the next one called cancellations the third which may consist ofproducing various types of reports and the fourth could be maintaining the data  about variousstrains, schedules and time tables and so on.<s> So we decompose the overall functionality in to subtask or sub processes this is the function decomposition.<p>

And was the function decomposition has been done and the sub processes have been identifiedwe also can establish what kind of data flow text place among these sub processes.<s> So this is themetrology  in the case of structured techniques and subsequent to doing this kind of analysiswhere we start from single process view and decompose it we precede further to establish what iscalled the current physical data  flow diagram.<s> So we start by studying the existing systems weunderstand the sub processes we try to find out what is done and where and how it is being done.So the beginning point is the existing systems.<s> From here the data flow diagram that we producenaturally corresponds to the current systems and it corresponds to the physical view of what ishappening in the real world.<s> So we call it physical current data flow diagram.<p>
