In addition to the sales file that we generate our system will require to use the product fileand location file and both these particular files are assumed to be maintained by the EDPdepartment of the company.<s> So it is in this particular context now that you are required todevelop a small software and basically give an answer to the current question that wehave  that is how big is  this particular software and obviously in turn  how much it willcost and how long it will take to develop this particular software.<s> Now the easiest way tolook at it would be as a data flow diagram.<p>

There  is a data flow diagram,  first level DFD drawn using games and [s3:54]notations the boundary of the system as implied.<s> So except the two squares which  aresupposed to be the external entities everything else is inside the system and you have oneinput and you have five outputs and an enquiry facility, there are three files and this cross[ar4:!6] indicates that there is a multiple depiction indicating that the file appears onlyonce in the data dictionary though it is shown  twice in the diagram.<s> So based on thisparticular kind of a situation now we were to calculate the number of functions that youhave then a simple enumeration can be done.<s> We have a monthly sales report coming inas  the  input and five summary reports and an enquiry and a sales file as a ILF and aproduct file and a location file as a EIF.<p>

(Refer Slide Time: 4:57)<p>

So if you again look at the slide we see all these particular functions mentioned.<s> The typeof functions has been indicated  here and we have drawn out the  average complexity,draw  function  points  for  each of these particular functions  and this indicates that thissystem is 57 unadjusted function point count.<s> Now if you were to look at this particularnumber  [.5:33] we need to now convert this unadjusted function point counts intoadjusted function point counts by identifying the weightage or the degree of influence forthe fourteen general system characteristics.<p>
