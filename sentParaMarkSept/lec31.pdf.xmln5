Again if you look into the slide  we can say that we can have  another particular curve.Here in this particular diagram,  instead of all the activities being performed as early aspossible we have now performed all the activities as late as possible without delaying thetotal time required for completing the project.<p>

Now, on the cumulative curve below you see a typical hysteresis kind of a curve and thisfrom an accountants  point of view will be very  easily viewed as what we call interestcost to the project, it is the additional interest cost to the project.So  here you see two conflicting views;  one from the top management of asking you tocomplete all the activities as early as possible and there is an accountant who would likeyou to complete all the activities as late as possible.<p>

Now what do you feel as a project manager?As  the project manager you have  a totally  different view of the situation.<s> The  first twoviews are not acceptable to you for a very  simple reason.<s> The  resources required forcompleting the jobs are not evenly distributed over the life span of the project.<p>

As a project manager you do not want a daily shuffling and  reshuffling and adding andsubtracting  of people to a project and  you would like to have a study a man powerallocation to your particular job and if  this so happens  you  are likely to have a mostcomfortable peaceful kind of a sailing.<s> So we have seen now from the diagram that thereare three preferences for doing this particular kind of a scheduling activity.<p>

There is one more thing  you must remember; whenever you are  developing a scheduleyou must keep certain amount of reserved time continuously or [b26:07].<s> Now this caneither  be  built into individual activity durations or  they  can be kept separately and youcan keep the results at your  project level or you can keep  these  particular results at theorganizational level.<s> So what is  important for you to know is that  the results are notrequired to be displayed to the people who are actually working on the project.<p>
