Finally,  one of the reusability enhancement features:  this is not really a  generalizationfeature;  this has to do with reusability enhancement in general;  is  that  there can  be aprocess of certification.<s> So, for example, if you are providing core bug components youare providing components that adhere to the core bugs standards then you might want tohave  it  certified by O and G  which is the organization that deals with the core bugstandard.<s> So, component certification could be fairly important because it will also give acertain level of trust to this  to the user of this components saying.<s> Oh..!<s> it has beencertified by Sun, it has been certified by this authority and I can therefore safely use thecomponent in my application knowing that it has met certain quality standards, it is fairlyrobust you know it is not going to destroy my application going forward and so on and soforth so there may be vendor support that is possible with this and so on and so forth.<s> So,that is something that has to be kept in mind as well.<p>

What is the reusability enhancement process itself look like?What we have  seen so far essentially is that  components can be built for reuse andcomponent applications can be built by reusing  components.<s> So what we have beendiscussing here is the process of reusability, is a process of increasing the reusability ofthe component itself.<s> Earlier we had also seen a similar which dealt with reusabilitywithin the software engineering life cycle.<s> How do you account for reusability withinyour application development life cycle?<s> Now  let us  take a look at the reusabilityenhancement process.<p>
