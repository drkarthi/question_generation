Typically extending the framework would imply that you either do some development inwhich case you are adding certain concrete classes to the framework that actuallyimplement some functionality that are provided as abstract interfaces within the system oryou add certain methods that are called in response to events that are recognized by theframework.<s> So these are called callback methods and every time the frameworkrecognizes  certain  events;  so  suppose your  total business volume has crossed a certainthreshold now it is impossible for a framework to figure out what you want to do whenyou cross the threshold may be you want to set up an alert, you want to send an e-mail toa bunch of people saying that his business volume has crossed the threshold, may be youwant to set up a press release etc etc.<s> Now the framework writer who is writing a genericframework has no idea so what he does is he says that I am going to generate an event oftype business volume threshold exceeded and when this event occurs then I am going tocall one of these functions  which is described  in  an  abstract way so there is noimplementation for this function, he has just called one of those functions and it is uptoyou as a  framework instantiator  to implement that particular function.<s> So you have towrite the code to receive that event and appropriately act on that event.<p>

Another example could be that your average execution time for a particular servlet  thatwas  executed in the web [.5052]  is suddenly spiked up by 50  percent and theframework an application management framework may give you the event and say it  isup to do what you want with it; you can raise an alarm, you can try to take auto correctiveaction and so on and so forth.<p>

The typical problems that exist with frameworks is the complexity.<s> So the framework isnot like a  single component which can be easily understood.<s> The  printing servicecomponent was fairly simple in nature it had small set of interfaces typically two to threeinterfaces are what makes up a component;  it may contain like four or five objects  thatbuild up  that particular component.<s> So it  is not very large in size and  it can be  easilyunderstood and it is also easy to discard and replace  that is the other advantage of thecomponent which is that if you find that the evolution of the system does not support thatcomponent then you can replace it with another  one fairly easily.<s> But a  framework is amuch larger commitment because of the size; it is almost an entire subsystem all the wayto being an entire system by itself.<s> Once it is instantiated it could form the bulk of yoursystem.<s> in such cases it is obviously not easy to replace the framework  thereforeevolution of the system may become much harder, also understanding the complexity thatgoes into creating one of these  frameworks  and therefore specializing it to meet yourneeds to configuring the framework for building these concrete classes that have to beadded to the framework for dealing with events that the framework may end up throwingout are all very very difficult to do in certain cases.<s> Obviously it has its own advantages.It is saving you a lot of development time, a lot of development effort, this has been againwell tested so it is a level of reuse that is much higher than that of components but it alsocomes with a certain baggage that you will have to deal with.<s> So, going forward what weare  going  to  take a look at is the remaining levels of reusability  (52:49)  we  aregoing to take a look at design patterns and levels of design reuse and what are  thebenefits and disadvantages of doing reuse at those levels.<p>
