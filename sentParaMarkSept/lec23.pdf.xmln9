So this takes lot of times in order to complete issue or receiving of a book at the counter.Verifications include many things such as the users quota is not exceeded.<s> For example astudent is permitted to issue 5 books.<s> So as he already issued five?<s> Which five books herehas issued?<s> We have to match their signatures.<s> If the return of a book is late then we haveto calculate the fine and so on and all these has to be done immediately at that time.<s> Thenthey also tell us that handling of claims  is very clumsy because this is just done byattaching a slip to the card which represents that book.<s> So every book has a card and onthat card they put a slip indicating who has claimed that book.<p>

Now this card is there for every book.<s> Similarly for every member such cards are there.So this will allow us to find out which books are issued to a particular user or to whom aparticular book is issued.<s> So  there are,  actually there are two ways by which the dataneeds to be co-related.<s> Given  a book to whom it is issued and given a member whichbooks are issued to him?<s> These  are the type of enquires because of which  lot of dataduplication is done and because of these duplication, there is a lot of book keeping thathas to be carried out at the counter.<s> And  possibly these are the reasons  which result inlong queues or enquiry function not being satisfactory or the claim service not beingsatisfactory.<s> We also talk to the management which is here, the assistant librarian and thelibrarian.<s> And  they tell us that reports and statistics about the usage of books are  veryinefficiently done.<s> They  take lot of time to get such reports and there is generally aproblem with overdue books and the lost books.<p>
