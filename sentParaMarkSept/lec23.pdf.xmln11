One of the requirement that is important and whichever alternative we come up with mustaddress this is that the member cards have to be seen and verified and we have to get thesignatures of the people when they issue the books.<s> Now  earlier there was someduplication.<s> We may think of some alternatives for removing that duplication.<s> Primarilythe duplication was because there where cards kept in the book which had to be signedwith the name of the person who is issuing that book.<p>

Similarly  every user had a pass book kind of a thing  available to him in which bookswhich are issued to him where written down.<s> Now this kind of duplication was necessarybut  its  also important for library to maintain this data.<s> So we must remember thatalthough this is contributing to the problem, we need to think of some good alternative sothat the book keeping can be reduced.<s> There are trays on the counter as we said earlierwhich contain the cards of the book or the cards of the member so that they can bequickly located in order to answers the queries of the users.<p>

At  this point now we feel that we have a very good understanding of the problem.<s> Wedont now need to go in more details, no need to prepare additional data flow diagrams orER diagrams.<s> We now can think of possible solution at a high level and  also work outtheir cost benefit analysis.<s> That is ultimately the goal of the feasibility.<s> So we note downwhat are the main reasons which contribute to the problem so that we can then verifywhether these are being addressed by all the alternatives that we are considering.<s> So firstreason is the duplication.<s> The data has to be accessible both by the users as well as by thebook.<s> So if I give my user identification, the library should be able to tell me what booksI have borrowed and if I give the book accession number, they should be able to tell mewhether the book is issued and to whom it is issued.<s> So this kind of duplication which isrequired needs to be addressed properly by the solution that we might recommend.<p>
