Let us look at the entities here; We have a car as the most important entity.<s> We can alsocreate various required attributes for this.<s> From car we are having a specialization calledsold car.<s> Then we have advertisement as an entity.<s> We have repairs as an entity and wehave customer as an entity besides also having salesman as the entity.<s> Car andadvertisement have a relationship called advertised cars and it is shown here as one tomany which means that an advertisement may contain many cars.<s> It also means that a caris advertised only once.<p>

This may be what the real world is in this case.<s> But it could also be many to many, thatmeans a car may be advertised multiple times and a single advertisement may indicatemany cars which are available on sale.<s> Then a car may have repairs.<s> So between car andrepairs entity, it  could be one to many type of a relationship.<s> Then a car is purchasedfrom some customer.<s> We must remember first from whom we have purchased this car.This is captured by the purchase relationship.<s> And finally we have the sale relationshipwhich shows customer, salesmen and the sold car as being related for not only to whomthe car was sold,  but also who participated in its negotiation  and who needs to be paidcommission.<s> This is the ER diagram where activities  are not shown, only the data isshown.<s> The entities are in way related to the different data stores that we had in the dataflow diagram.You should validate this ER diagram on whether it actually defines the same content orthe same information domain that was present in the case of the DFD or the data flowdiagram where data stores were shown, containing the same data.<s> Of course there neednot be a one to one match between the ER diagram and the data flow diagram.<s> We neednot show each one of them as a data store there.<s> But essentially all the information thatwas implicitly indicated in the data flow diagram should be present in the ER model.<s> Wewill look at another example.<s> In fact I will stress here the importance of preparing  thedata flow diagram yourself.<s> Data flow diagrams once prepared can be easily understoodand can be used as a good learning exercise.<s> But unless you do a few of them yourself,you will not understand the challenges of preparing a good data flow diagrams.<p>
