And finally the detail design may typically ends up driving the unit test plan, which is thelast box on the right side of the diagram.<s> But it may also contribute to some subsystemintegration test plan.<s> So, if you hierarchically breakdown the system into subsystems oflower and lower complexity, then there maybe some subsystem integration, but at a highlevel you may not end up seeing the subsystem integration test plan box.<s> What you see isacceptance test plans box, a system integration test plan, and finally the unit test plan andpieces of it.So, the detailed design will drive the unit test plan, and as soon as the code is done theunit test around on the code for each module; this is done on an individual module level,and once the  code has been unit tested or  the components have been unit tested,  thensubsystem integration and system integration testing is done using the appropriate plan;either subsystem integration test plan or a system integration test plan.And once this is done, it then goes into acceptance testing using acceptance test plan thatyou have already created before.<p>

So it is kind of like a V-process, start from the requirement specification and goes back tothe product or  the service that is being delivered to the  customer and what are  thedifferent stages of testing as it is integrated with the development process itself is whatthis is trying to show you.<p>

Now, this is something that you might have seen during the software testing part of it, buthere the structure of a software test plan.The software test plan primarily focuses on what is the testing process going to be.<p>

For example, how are we going to test software?It is also focuses on things like: What is the test environment going to look like?<s> Are yougoing to have a full scale test environment which exactly duplicates what the productionis going to be like?<s> Are you going to have a scaled  down version of this?<s> If there is ascaled down version, then is there a process to extrapolate the results to get at what thissoftware is going to behave like in the fully scaled up version under  productionconditions?<p>
