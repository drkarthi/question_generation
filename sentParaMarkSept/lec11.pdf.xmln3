This is one way of classifying employees.<s> The other way could be based on their function basedon the type of work they do.<s> Here we have created another specialization into categories calledfaculty,  clerk and technician.<s> We have also identified few attributes.<s> For faculty we have rankand area of research, for clerk we may have typing speed and for technician we may have skillcode.<s> Always remember that we do specialization or generalization with some objective in mind.It is possible that you would define a relationship between the faculty and a course called teachrelationship.<p>

It is best to create the teach relationship with faculty and not with the employee because there aresome employees who do not teach.<s> The purpose of this specialization therefore is to indicateadditional behavior or some specific behavior of these specialized entities and you also identifyattributes which are meaningful.<p>

Remember that what we said earlier that every employee need not fall into the categories givenhere  every faculty obviously IS-A employee.<s> This is the way you read the relationship facultyIS-A employee.<s> But in the case of specialization every employee need not be in the categoriesthat you have defined.<s> We may have an employee who is neither faculty nor clerk nor technician.He has a role which is not relevant for our modeling.<s> We have not identified additional roles.<s> It ispossible that only these three roles are meaningful to us in the model that we are creating.Where as in this case we have some employees who are permanent employees and some who aretemporary,  it is possible that these two categories cover all the employees  and there are noemployees who are left  out.<s> Because they are the  binary classification,  either it has to bepermanent or it has to be temporary.<s> There is nothing other than these two  and hence  thisclassification is complete.<s> Specialization is going from an entity and creating special categories.Whereas generalization is going from a given set of entities, finding out what is common, thenextracting it and defining that as a general kind of an entity.<s> Note the difference in the notationalso in the case of generalization.<s> We had arrows pointing towards general entity and here wehave the classification or specialization going from top to down direction.<s> Let us examine thesetwo concept generalization and specialization  in the context of a concept in object orientation,the concept of inheritance.<p>
