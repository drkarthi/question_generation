We might also indicate what are the operations that users may have to perform as a specialoperation; is there something which is done at the start of the day or end of the day; do youverify at the end of the day the list of books which have been issued and which  have beentaken out from the library.<s> So, these things maybe done as a one-time activity specifically sothose are listed;  some of these maybe done by the system some of them maybe donecompletely manually.<p>

Similarly, we indicate how the user is expected to do regular backups and so on.<s> We may alsodefine some site adaptation requirements in case this system will be implemented in manylibraries.<s> Since we are implementing it only for one library this may not apply in our case.<s> Ifit  requires to be implemented at multiple sites we will have to give various adaptationrequirements.<p>

Next, we also identify the acceptance criteria.<s> This is actually a very important criteria whichwill become the basis for acceptance by the user once the software is developed.<s> So, at thispoint itself we are indicating what we will consider as our responsibility in helping the user inaccepting the software.<s> So we are saying that before acceptance of the system the developerswill demonstrate all functionalities of the system for sample data of 100 books, 100 membersand  2000  books.<s> So we will indicate issues receiving of these books etc  this will bedemonstrated to the user.<p>

The developer will supply suitable test cases, expected results and this will be demonstratedto the users.<s> Once  this will be  this is done we will assume that the acceptance has gone tosatisfactory.<s> This is then the SRS document.<s> As you can see here all the analysis work thatwe have done which has helped us to get various kind of information has been now recordedformally in the SRS document.<s> This SRS document will now be submitted and there will be areview the review would be done by the user they would tell us whether all the requirementshave been captured properly it may also be reviewed by peers in terms of how good a job wehave done in identifying various aspects of the system that we need to develop.<p>
