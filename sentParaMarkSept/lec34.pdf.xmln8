Then what we do during the project?During  the project what you need to do is to ensure that the verification and validationtakes place as planned.<s> It  involves planning and then implementing the plan.<s> You mustunderstand what is the difference between verification and validation?<s> For that let us lookat the picture here.<p>

In case you had a job which required a series of steps to be taken then this would be yourverification activity.<s> At the end of each particular step you make sure that you got the jobright.<s> And  validation would involve making sure that this particular job is reallyachieving its intended purpose.<s> So this would be your verification this would be yourvalidation activity.<p>

Many  times you find that both these  verification and validation activities at differentpoints of time planned to a different level of severity.<s> Then there is ensuring throughoutthat adherence to standard.<s> Of  course we have chosen  the standard before hand butchoosing the standard does  not imply that they will  automatically  adhere to.<s> there aresmall exceptions like suppose you are interested in making sure that the C coding is doneaccording to coding standards you may not worry too much about the coders followingthe standard but you could easily write a program and this particular  program couldreformat the code  according to C  coding standard of the organization.<s> But  that is adifferent issue altogether.<s> Then  we have independent assessment or some kind of audit.This particular activity is not a part of the project.<s> The audits can be of different types, itcan be internal audits or  external audits  but in this context we normally mean internalaudit.<s> So, periodically an independent assessment that the project does have a plan and itis following that particular plan is very important.<p>
