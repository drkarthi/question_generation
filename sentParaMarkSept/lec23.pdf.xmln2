In this module we will do a case study on the software methodology that we have studiedin this course.<s> The purpose of the case study is to illustrate the entire development lifecycle.<s> We will look at how the different physics we have identified can be appliedsystematically step by step in developing a software application.<s> The purpose of this casestudy is to focus on the methodology,  what are deliverables,  what steps and techniqueswe go through.<s> Idea is to understand the entire process of development as an engineeringprocess and see that the various deliverables are  produced,  reviewed and then only wefollow subsequent stages in the development.<s> So this case study is a case study on libraryapplication.<s> Its  a application where the library is handle issue and receiving of booksfrom the users of the library.<s> So this is a real realistic application and the way it is beingpresented is the way it can be done and it should be done.<s> Now the organization we aretalking about here could be any library of any university.<p>
