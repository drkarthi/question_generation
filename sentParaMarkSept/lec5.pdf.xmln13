A high level architecture is going to be performed upon analyzing and reading thesesystem specifications.<s> And these are typically used for incorporating into contract that issigned  between the client and the customer in this particular case.<s> In principle,requirements  need to stay away from design.<s> The requirements  are meant to state whatthe system is to do and not how the system is to accomplish the task.<s> In practice,sometimes it is difficult and this distinction gets blurred and they become inseparable incertain  situations.<s> So the system architecture for example may be designed to structurethe requirements itself.<s> The system may interoperate with other  systems  that generatedesign requirements and that can also be a situation in which the line blurs.<s> The use of aspecific design may itself be a requirement, a classy example where the notion of framesversus the plain HTML.<p>

So far we have primarily looked at natural language specification requirements.<s> Now wecan take a  look at some of the alternatives that may exist in using natural language orEnglish like language in order to specify requirements.<s> There are three primary categoriesof alternatives that we can take a look at.<s> One is structuring the same natural languagerequirement that we have been talking about.<s> But give a very small degree of flexibilityto the requirement specification person by using forms or templates.<s> The forms are kindof pre-canned and they give a certain degree of flexibility required.<s> But mostly it allowsyou to specify things like modules and on a per module basis which allows you to specifycertain inputs/outputs, what the module is expected to do and so on.<p>

It does pre suppose a certain modularization but that is something that cannot be avoidedwith this type of specification.<s> The second alternative is mainly that of what are calleddesign description languages and graphical notations are often used in these languages.So they are not textual languages, but they are languages which have a certain degree ofgraphical notations.<s> They are UML with  use cases and message  sequence charts is anexample which is the most popular one.<s> Even though UML has been used as a designlanguage it can certainly be used to layout certain set of requirements as well.<p>
