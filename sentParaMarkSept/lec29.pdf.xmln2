So,  when you look at the software project management basically we start with thequestion what is project and what is an operation.<s> Basically an organization achieves itsobjectives by organizing its activities  either  as  project or operations.<s> Operations  are theongoing activities of the organization very repetitive in nature whereas projects are non-routine one time activity.<s> For instance, developing a payroll software is a project whereasrunning the payroll package every month becomes an operation.<p>

So,  projects are often used by the organization to  respond to situation which cannot behandled normally in the operation kind of a setup and although the projects are non-repetitive in nature they consume a lot of resource and therefore they need to be managedin a very proper kind of a manner.<p>

Now let us take a simple example.<s> Suppose we have an IT system to be introduced in anorganization, it can be done as a collection of several projects.<s> For instance, you can havea consulting form to establish the exact scope of a particular project; say general ledger,accounts payable,  accounts  receivable  and what kind of strategies to be used fordeveloping such an application.<s> Once you have done that you may have another projectto sort  of interview  the users and find out whether the proposed system will make asignificant difference to their operations and activity.<s> Then once you have zeroed in  onthe project in the analysis phase itself you may take several projects like, for instance, todevelop the module, you may need a process module to be developed, you might need adata model to be developed, a timeframe model to be developed.<s> So, if you had a systemto be developed  for a refinery  these activities themselves could be significantly largeprojects.<p>
