So  changes can come in either side from an external source as has been set  here as theuser or it can come in from the internal sources as well and this can be applied to all thethree categories of change;  especially the release planning and the impact analysismodules are very different for perfective maintenance verses adaptive maintenance versescorrective maintenance and so on corrective maintenance and so on so that is somethingwe have to be careful about.<s> But typically a  bunch of related corrective maintenancefeatures of bug fix is going through  a single path release;  you do  not  introduce newfeatures into a path release; you might introduce a minor release where a bunch of usersenhancements that have been requested which are essentially new feature developmentsbut very very small features are introduced and you never mix that along with the changeto an environment.<s> So, for example, if we are changing the operating system version youdo  not  want to mix that along with the bunch of enhancement that are  being released.You want to try and keep these things as separate patches as we possibly can so that eachthing can be individually applied without it affecting the other changes in the system.<p>

So,  change request which is  the first step in the process is simply a request for  systemchanges and this can have a particular template or a format, for example, who is the usersubmitting the change  request,  was it a bug in the system, is that  a new feature  to beadded  in the system;  if it is a bug in the system then to reproduce the exact conditionsunder which the error occurred; so, for example, the user was on this particular screen hewas trying to enter this kind of data and the system crashed; that could be an example of aerror report that is coming in or it could be a change request for a new feature; I alreadytold about the changes in fields,  I wanted  to change the control  flow  of a piece ofsoftware in some way and so on.<p>

In principle every single change is very carefully analyzed; all of these are entered into abug tracking system so there are system tools that are available and every change requestgoes into the system and there is typically a change each control board that does  theimpact analysis of this and decides as to which change can go into which release and thischange control board as it is called is composed of some developers,  some  maintainersand some of the management staff who sit down together and figure out how to schedulein the changes in an appropriate way to be released.<p>
