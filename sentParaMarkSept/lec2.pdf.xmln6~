Good tools need to be acquired in order to do a prototype because we want to completethe prototype  quickly in the minimum cost.<s> So this is an investment we may have to make which adds to the cost of the project.<s> So one of the problems with prototyping is that it may lead to a higher project cost and there are other problems that we have just mentioned.<s> So when we have such difficulties based on the requirements or based on the situation we might choose some other development methodologies, one that may seemagain obvious is the iterative development.<p>


In the iterative development we define the initial scope and try to build a product which will meet the initial scope that was identified and then release it quickly to get customer feedback.<s> Here iterative development is a good methodology for those software projects which want to build products, which will be of use to many customers.<s> So here we are developing a product whose functionality may not be clearly known or there may be too many features that we may want to provide.<s> But we would rather like to release a product quickly capture the market and get customer feedback.<s> So this is the situation which is ideal for iterative development.<p>

Here the development takes place in multiple iterations and many versions of the software may be released.<s> You must be already familiar that some of the products such as database products or packages like pay roll or accounting packages are available in the market in versions.<s> Basically the latest version represents additional features which have been added from the previous version based on the requirements as perceived or based onthe customers feedback.<s> When we develop the initial version we may of course follow any method.<s> For example, we may follow the waterfall method for the initial version of the product.<p>
