Once it is enabled it typically moves to a waiting state.<s> Waiting in the sense thatsomebody has to typically program the microwave to run for sixty seconds and you wantit to run on a high power or low power.<s> Once the microwave is enabled that is it is beenunlocked so to speak,  it moves into the waiting state and from the waiting state it canessentially move to a running state when it is programmed.<s> Programmed  in this casewould essentially mean that somebody turned on the timer at a certain power level andonce it is in the waiting state, it can be programmed to the running state.<s> Once it finishesrunning it can come back into the waiting state.<s> This is a done event.<s> For example thetimer runs out could be a done  event.<s> You have set it up for a minute or two minutesand the timer ran out of at the end of two minutes and this would mean that it is finishedrunning and therefore move back into a waiting state.<p>

We could have avoided for example the enabled state.<s> The disabled can directly make itgo to the waiting state.<s> In that case the diagram would look something like it goes fromdisabled directly here for the enable  event.<s> It is not going to take the  path  fromDisabled to Enabled, so we are going to cut out this state entirely.<p>

Or we can have an enabled state and we can say that set power level is going to move itfrom the enabled state on to a waiting state with a certain power level.<s> So the diagram canbe made as complicated as we wanted to be.<s> But essentially this should describe exactlythe states that a microwave oven in this case is going to go through.<s> This will often helpthe designer decide as to what kind of interface we are to lend this particular device.<s> Forexample there should be some kind of digital interface to enable it,  there need to be aninterface to set the power levels of the needs the interface to turn microwave on and stopmicrowave and so on.<p>
