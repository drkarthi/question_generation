From our particular point of view if we were to look at the generic process area they arefour of them.<s> Basically it is the commitment to perform.<s> How we prove that appropriatepolicies and sponsorships is available for achieving what we are planning to achieve.<s> Weneed to demonstrate a  commitment to perform.<s> Next,  just commitment is not goodenough and you need ability to perform.<s> Things like, the spirit is willing but the flesh isre-kind of  approach is not going to work;  you need a very healthy spirit followed by avery healthy flesh so it is the ability to perform.<s> Process  documentations,  resourceallocation, assignment of responsibility, trainings etc needs to be taken care of.<s> Once yougot the ability and the commitment that also will not make things happen unless you haveimplementation.<p>

Hence, directing the implementation is very important; measurements, control practices,how do you start, when do you start, when do you finish, how do you report, how do youmeasure all these things need to be specified.<s> And last but not the least what you need tospecify is verifying.<p>

You  might do a good implementation but you may  not  be very sure that the things arehappening exactly the way so you need a QC, some kind of an  ensuring  that theimplementation is happening.<s> So periodic reviews are also required, management reviewsmay be required, some kind of auditing may be required etc.<s> So in this particular way youmust have some generic practices such as commitment to perform, the ability to perform,directing the implementation and verifying the implementation etc associated with all theparticular processes.<p>

Once we got the practice what is the goal?Goal  is the high level outcome to be achieved by implementing practices.<s> The  types ofgoals again can be specific or generic.<s> there is one generic goal  like in a per process areaso we will say yes  we would like to achieve the error levels to be reduced from so manyto so many per thousand lines of code.<s> So  the same generic goal is applicable to allprocess  areas at the maturity level  and from that point of view we would say thatobviously all process areas at the higher maturity level must have the genericrequirements of the lower levels.<s> There are one to three specific goals that are attributedto each particular process area.<p>
