We generally maintain a list of features which have to be implemented in future releasesand we will come out with the versions in the future as we implement these features andrelease the product.<s> Each version will be analyzed and we will keep on updating ourfeatured list.<s> So our third methodology is the iterative development.<s> Finally we havemethodology called spiral model.<s> In the spiral model we go through the development incycles and each cycle is divided into four quadrants.<s> These quadrants as you see here arenamed;  the first quadrant,  we tried to define the objectives alternatives what are theconstraints.<s> So this is the starting point.<s> Then we evaluate those alternatives and clearlyidentify the risks.<s> Now these risks may be pertaining to the interfaces,  pertaining toperformances and so on.<s> Based on these risks in the third quadrant of the cycle, we triedto define what implementation will perform, and after the third in the fourth quadrant weidentify how we will plan the subsequent cycle.<p>

So in this case we have development going on in cycles and as we go through the cyclesthe different risk issues are addressed and more refinements are done to our strategies, tothe functionalities in the case of spiral model.<s> So spiral model basically identifies risks atevery step and it identifies the ways of addressing those risks either by following theprototyping methods, or going through simulations, or carrying out benchmarking.<p>

So at every development step we will decide in what way we want to follow.<s> It  isprimarily  a risk driven approach.<s> The spiral model consists of different cycles.<s> In eachcycle we try to address some risk element that we see.<s> And we plan the development, inorder to identify ways of addressing that risk.<s> So if we have a risk perception about whatkind of user interfaces we should build, then we do prototyping.<s> If a user interface andperformance issues are quite well understood, then the risk may be just the developmentrisk.<s> In that case we decide to follow the waterfall model.<p>
