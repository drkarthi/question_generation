Now  you write out this high level specification without writing the code of  what  thewithdrawer has to do and then it generates the backend code; at least the code frameworkcan be generated.<s> So you do  not  have to,  for example,  write the specification in Clanguage, in Java language or anything like that; you write out in this high level Englishlike language and then it translates it  into a framework within a specific programminglanguage  say  C  or Java and  at that point of time you will  just fill in the details of thebusiness logic and not worry about writing the code for the rest of the framework itself.<p>

In  that case,  for  example,  the account has to be published  so that somebody else canaccess it and all those functions are automatically generated by the code generator in thiscase.<s> It  is obviously a  very  very cost effective method of doing things but  programgenerators are very specialized they are not generically  usable everywhere so  a  fewthings that are fairly general as things like lexes and parsers but otherwise you take a lookat code generators and case tools and things like that  they are  pretty pretty specializedand it is not very often used.<p>

So  the reuse through program generation  the process looks like what is shown in thediagram here.<s> You basically give the description of an application and the description ofan  application is fed into a program generator;  program generator has some applicationdomain knowledge that it picks up so this is the notion of reuse of algorithms; so, parserfor example here knows what the notion of an abstract syntax tree is,  it knows  thealgorithm to construct an abstract syntax given a particular parsing technique and so on.So through this you basically give a grammar in this case in the case of parser and then itbasically generates a program in this particular case that can parse a particular language.So,  for example,  if you wanted  to write a parser for Java you write down the Javagrammar, you give it to a program generator and it would generate a compiler for Java inthis particular case.<p>
