Subsequently when we proceed in the design,  we will try to consider the physicalrepresentation of this conceptual model,  the internal representation,  how to make userprocessing more efficient, and also how to restrict the views of different users so that theyaccess those data which is relevant to them.<s> These external, internal or physical aspects ofthe model are generally worked out when we proceed into the design andimplementation.<s> Our first objective in the development of the solution is to build aconceptual data model.<s> A good data model should meet some important requirements andthese are quite straight forward.<s> A  good model should naturally be easy to understandbecause we will expect users to validate the kind of model we are trying to build torepresent his application domain.<s> Users can understand it if it is a simple model, if it hasonly a few concepts.And it can be specified in top down fashion, so that you do not have to give all the detailstogether but you give details in step by step fashion.<s> In fact the top down specification isvery important in any modeling because we cannot comprehend a complex system at onepoint.<s> We have to see it at different levels of details and that is permitted by top downspecification.<p>

These are the characteristics of a good model.<s> Let  us also define what we mean by amodel what does a model consists of?<s> A model consists of a few important concepts.<s> Itwill also give us some form by which those concepts can be represented,  we call theseconstructs.<s> Construct is a representation for a concept, but model primarily offers a set ofconcepts and it also offers a few operations on those concepts.<s> This is what a model ismade up of.<p>
