This function is translating the input space to some kind of output space O.<s> So a programis in sense, a mathematical object and we can write F (I) is equal to O and the languagethat is being used here is nothing but a mathematical notation and therefore we can provecertain properties about it.<s> For example does the software do what they supposed to do,the second is: is it doing something that it is not supposed to do.<s> Both of these things aresomething that has to be proved about the software and the mathematical model will helpus create this proof.<s> With that we can take a look at different types of mathematicalmodels.<s> One of them is algebraic specification that we are going to be looking at shortly.But before that we can look at something much simpler which is called IO assertions it isa part of algebraic specifications as well but IO assertions are much simpler.<s> IO assertionsimply take the form S  {P}  Q  and what this is trying to say is if S holds before theprogram P is executed, then Q is going to hold after the program P is executed.<p>

An example of IO assertion which is a way of formally modeling software can be that,sum is equal to  0 that  is the pre conditional assertion.<s> And the function that is going totake place at the software program that is going to run says for i is equal to 0 to n sum isequal to sum + Ai.<s> This is the definition of the program that is going to run and after theprogram is executed a certain condition is going to hold true and that condition in thiscase is going to be sum  is equal to1NJAj=.<s> Essentially it is software specification whichhas a precondition that is the variable whose value is null or equal to zero.<p>
