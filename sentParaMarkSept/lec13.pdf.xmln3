What is correctness?<s> Correctness has to do with fact that at least software has been builtconforms to the specification, the requirements that were laid out in the beginning of theprocess.<s> The  means of ensuring  the  correctness are:  testing and debugging.<s> This is onestraight forward mean.<s> The  other one is layering or architectural approaches towardsensuring correctness.<s> So the changes in the lower layers  essentially do not affect.<s> Theyonly affect the layer that is sitting on the top of it.<s> For example when you change theoperating system platform,  software which manages say functional needs of sayinventory management is not isolated from the operating system layer.<s> Then you wouldhave to make changes through out the software and more change to the code that is beingmade, the more perturbation that is being caused in the system, the more likely that it isgoing to be a quality problem in the software and in the near future.<p>

The next quality factor that is very important is robustness and robustness basically refersto the ability the software to deal  with abnormal condition.<s> So those that  were notspecified for example or they might have been specified.<s> Correctness and robustnesswhen put together produces reliable software at the end of the day.<s> These are factors thatwe should focus on.<p>

However there are other factors as well that we do well take into account and some ofthese are expressed in this slide;  extendibility of the software.<s> The extendibility is theability to not necessarily change the system but an addition  to the system.<s> For examplewe were building a module of inventory management and we would like to add ability todo logistic planning in that.<s> For example you are managing inventory as well as you aregoing to have to manage shipments around to  various warehouses.<s> So logistic planninghas to be added to this.<s> When such a major requirement is brought into the picture, if thefirst piece of software,  the inventory planning system was not built right in terms ofdesign then it is not going to be very extensible.<p>
