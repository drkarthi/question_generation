How are these two concepts related with inheritance?<s> Obviously we see that there is aninheritance implied here from the super class or the generalized class to the special cases.Because the common attributes are defined at the general level and the specific attributes aredefined at a specialized level.<s> Naturally the attributes at the generic level are inherited by theentities which are at the next level.<s> So there is an inheritance, the attributes are inherited by themore specialized entities from the base entity.<p>

The sub class or sub set automatically inherits the attributes defined at the super class and superset level.<s> There is an inheritance in both the cases whether it is a generalization or whether it is aspecialization.<s> The attributes of the generic entity are inherited by the subclass or the subsetentity.<s> Hence inheritance is present in both the cases.<s> However, the direction of the inheritance orthe direction in which we have created the model is an important difference.<s> That is the reasonwe have  distinguished generalization from specialization.<s> We do generalization in the bottomup direction, we have gone from more specialized entities and created a general entity, whereasin the case of specialization we started with an entity and created specific cases of that entity.It is important to distinguish between these two cases.Let  us next examine the concept of aggregation.<s> Aggregation is used for building complexentities  from existing entities or possibly existing entities and relationships between them.<s> Weare creating a complex entity and that would be called as an aggregated entity.<s> There are twoways by which we can do that.<s> We can create an attribute whose value itself is another entity.Usually we have talked about the attributes and we said that attributes have values and so far wehave seen attributes which are primarily simple attributes like age or roll number or hostelnumber.<s> But there can be attributes whose value is itself an entity.<p>
