So these are important project monitoring aspect and we use different types of analysistechniques by representing the project plan in a proper form such as a bar  chart or asactivity network.<s> Each development step you will recall,  will give information fortracking the progress of the development.<s> We had said earlier that every step producesinput for the management and this information will be used by the management foridentifying possible bottom necks and the reason for delays if there is any.<s> And we willenable the management to take corrective action.<s> So project plan allows you to monitorthe project and also control over the progress of the project.<s> Let  us  now summarize wehave in this particular lesson.<p>

We have we have introduced the software engineering topic.<s> We have looked at theimportance of applying engineering approach to development of large software project.We define what we mean by engineering.<s> So now we should be very clear how webenefit by applying an  engineering approach to software development.<s> We identifieddifferent types of software processes.<s> We defined a stepwise process definition where thesoftware methodology consists of multiple steps.<s> We made a very rigorous definition ofwhat we mean by a software development step.<s> It has entry criteria exit criteriasomething specific to be done, some techniques to be employed some documentation, orsome other output to be produced which will be used by subsequent steps.<s> So the essenceof engineering approach is to define a stepwise methodology for carrying out the project.<p>

We saw the waterfall model and other models.<s> We tried to understand their strengths andtheir weaknesses.<s> We saw that the waterfall model consists of many steps arranged in aproper sequence and it identifies many different deliverables which are very importantnot only for completing the project but for future  maintenance of the project.<s> We sawthen limitations of waterfall model and how other models tried to address thoselimitations such as the prototyping model or the spiral model.And finally we briefly talked about the project planning.<s> Key observations we made hereis that if you do not have a project plan you cannot manage the project.<s> And projectmanagement is actually very important in any large project.<s> And another key point wasthat,  in order to prepare a project plan it is important that we learn measurementtechniques.<s> We keep historical data,  we learned  how to effort how to do the effortestimation.<s> We also understand how the effort is distributed in different steps.<s> So once wehave a good understanding about these issues and we  also maintain data about similarprojects that we might have done in the past, we will be able to prepare the project planwith a great amount of confidence and we will be able to carry out the whole project asper the plan.<p>
