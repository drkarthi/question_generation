There can be compliance to standards because typically when a component is built to bereused in multiple situations it is built to some kind of a standard because that is theeasiest way of ensuring that it is applicable across a wide variety of situations and acrossa wide set of systems and therefore when you reuse such components you automaticallybecome compliant with the standards without having to make an additional effort andwhat you are essentially really bringing to the fore in case of reuse is that you are reusingthat intellectual property that went into creating the component in the first place insteadof having to bring the people who built that component and make them build it again.<p>

You are basically capturing that intellectual property, you are you are making effectiveuse of the specialist knowledge that existed so it may be a domain specific componentthat you are reusing; so, for example, something that would build a business processflow, automate a business process flow, this could be a backend server side componentthat knows how to control workflow; this can be reused in several.<s> it can be embeddedas the workflow engine and the workflow engine now becomes the component that canbe used across any project that requires the workflow.<p>

You do not build your own workflow engine any more just like you would not build yourown database; you would not even think about building your own database today, youwould always buy a database and you will just build your own schema and insert it intothe database.<s> So, just as we have taken infrastructure for granted almost today thequestion is can we raise that level of abstraction and take application components,frameworks and indeed entire applications for granted and then build on top of thatinstead of doing all that all over again.<p>

Now at the same time we have seen all the benefits it certainly comes with certain cause,there are some requirements for design with reuse.<s> The first thing is it must be possibleand easy to find the appropriate components to reuse.<s> So there  must be some kind of acomponent repository that has been set up, it must be easy to search that repository, thecomponents must be very very well documented otherwise you may not be able find thecomponents  at all  and  even if you do find the likely component you may never realizewhether it fully solves your problem.<s> And there only two ways of going about doing this:one is you test the component thoroughly to figure out and you can kind of take it apartand figure out whether it meets your need or  it comes with  appropriate documentationand when it comes with the documentation then you do not have to spend as much timein trying to figure out whether it is appropriate for your need and that is the real benefitthat you are going to save time at the end of the day and certainly you need to have theconfidence that this component is complete,  the component is solid in terms of  in theterms of the capability that it provides;  it has been thoroughly tested and that it will bereliable and it will behave exactly as has been specified and that confidence can come outof various means it can be for example certified by some kind of a Standards Body thatcan say this component has been certified, it has been tested independently other than thepersons who developed the component.<s> The other way of gaining confidence is that it hasbeen used in several situations production situations to build real systems before you arepicking it up and using it in your particular project.<p>
