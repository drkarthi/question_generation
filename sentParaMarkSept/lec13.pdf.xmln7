The term is not very well defined, but we shall try to put a definition to the notion of whatabstraction is within software development and there can be different levels of abstractionand that is what in fact object orientation is all about.<s> Basically object orientation is aboutintroducing abstraction at various levels within the software design process or with in thesoftware construction process.<s> The third key to achieving structure quality is continuity inthe process.We know that there are various phases in the software development lifecycle startingfrom requirement, going on to analysis and specification, design, implementation, testingand so on Often  what usually  happen  with software development project of the past isthat, English was the common denominator for specifying software requirement.<p>

It was up to a human or a person to take the requirements  specification  documents,understand it and create a specification do the process of analysis.<s> With  that result,  tocheck whether the analysis that had been done or the specification that had been written,conform to the requirements that were  given in the first place.<s> It was not possible to bedone by a machine,  it could not be verified that the analysis was indeed correct.<s> Thespecification that has been turned out as a result of analysis could indeed be traced backto the requirements.<s> So  let us try to pictorially put this out different phases.<s> The firstphase is that of analysis and in goes the requirements documents and outcomes aspecification right.<p>

Once this specification is then fed to a design phase and out comes a design.<s> The designis fed to the implementation phase and outcomes code.<s> The code is then fed to a testingphase which basically verifies correctness.<s> So there is input in every module and anoutput from the module.<s> This is a process and in the process there are artifacts that arecreated by every process.<s> The analysis creates the  artifacts  as  Specification.<s> Designcreates the  artifact  of design.<s> Implementation creates the artifacts  of code and testingbasically gives you a Boolean answer  to whether something is correct or wrong.<s> In thetraditional software engineering process,  these artifacts that we have laid out here forexample, the specification, the design and so on, do not get reused from step to step of theprocess.<s> In other words there is a human who reads the requirements document, comesup with the specification and another human reads the specification and comes up with adesign.So to go  back and verify  whether the specification meets the requirement, whether thedesign meets the specifications,  whether the code meets the design which in turn meetsthe specification and  the requirements is simply not possible, because there is lack ofcontinuity in this process.<p>
