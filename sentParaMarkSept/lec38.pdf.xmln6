Now  these steps  2  and  3  can be repeated  large number of times so that we get aprobability distribution for the results.<s> At the end of our risk quantification we will comeout with a ranked set of risks which need to be tackled by us on a priority basis.Obviously  all the sundry  (35:16) risks also are to be  tackled but they will not be dealtwith in such a great detail.<s> So, for the identified risk now we need to plan a response.<s> sothe risk response planning process involves developing options to combat the risks.<p>

If  you look at the slide let us  say that the risk response planning process involvesdeveloping options to combat the risks.<s> There are several strategies which we can use orwe can have back up strategies also which can be chosen from amongst  the  severalstrategies that are available and this will help us in facing our risks.<p>

After selecting the appropriate strategy specific actions must be developed to implementthe strategies that we got in mind.<s> So, the risk response planning includes identificationand assignment of responsibilities to individuals or to groups of people for each particularresponse.<s> Planning alone does not do anything like identifying and deciding what to do,do not by itself get implemented so the responsibility has to be specifically assigned to besomebody.<s> Effective response planning is something that directly determines whether therisk will increase or decrease during the projects particular life.<s> So if you do the responseplanning  well then  you will find that you have  very well taken care of these particularsituations.<p>

Now what are the typical kinds of strategies that you can follow?Typical risk response strategies are; risk avoidance, risk transfer, risk mitigation and riskacceptance.<p>

Now let us look at these particular strategies a little more in detail.<s> As the name suggeststhe risk avoidance strategy involves eliminating the risk usually by eliminating its cost orto protect the project from its impact.<s> It is like not using a particular technology which isavailable in a market but it is not yet very proven so we may not go by that but we will goby one of the established technologies so we have avoided the possibility of risk arisingout of unknown technology.<p>
