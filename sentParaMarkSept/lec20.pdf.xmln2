You can also create your own independent libraries which can be then linked as andwhen required.<s> Hence  modular design can  also lead to good modular packaging.<s> Theprogramming or the implementation environment must support these constructs,  so thatyou are able to benefit your logical modular decomposition that you do during youranalysis and design phase.<s> At the same time you also follow the principles of structureprogramming  during implementation and then you again do a  good structuraldecomposition as your deployment entities and so on.<s> This method can be used in variousphases of your software cycle.<p>

We are going to look at some very basic ideas which come  out from single entry andsingle exit concept.<s> Dijkstra stated this structured programming as,  programming withhelp of using single entry single exit blocks and he wrote a paper which was titled asGOTO considered harmful.<p>

He said that goto is not good.<s> It results in &lt;not audible&gt; structured programming, becausebasically if you use a GOTO  statement in your program, you can write code which isvery hard to understand and  hard to debug.<s> You can jump from any instruction to anyinstruction using a simple GOTO.<s> And you may not be able to structure your programs interms of well laid out blocks which can be then connected from smaller levels to higherlevels in a top down fashion, so that you can understand the program easily from topdown fashion.<s> GOTO  has been considered as bad,  but you can see that in assemblylanguage we use it quite frequently, or use a jump instruction.<s> At higher levels we havemuch better abstractions.<p>
