It is a combination of functionality and data in a single entity and almost always most ofthese object models are associated with a de facto  standard that has come into placecalled UML which is used for modeling object diagrams of various kinds.<s> UML - UnifiedModeling Language and is a formal description of what we are trying to eventually build.You can use the UML in the analysis stage and you can use the UML in the design stageof a construction life cycle.<s> Various object models can be produced.<s> First of all, the coreobject model that gives you the different objects and the relationship between the objects.Finally the inheritance models, the aggregation models and interaction models which arestate transition and so on and so forth.The message sequence diagrams we will take a look at some of them during this courseof lecture.<s> One of the reasons why we are tending to move towards object orientedtechniques construction of software is, because they help us reflect more naturally on realworld constructs.<s> For example real world construct is something that is a combination ofthe data and the capabilities that can be performed on the data itself.<p>

In a library subsystem for example, remember we talked about the order for example, theorder is composed of several different pieces of data;  what are the articles that wereordered, what  is the cost of the each  article and so on.<s> That  is more natural way ofthinking about things.<s> It is easier to modulate it using these kinds of constructs and it hasbecome a popular  very paradigm for constructing software today.<s> The hard partobviously is recognizing what are objects, what are not objects, what is the granularity ofthe objects that you end up choosing in building the system and so on.<s> It also has gone along way in building reusable systems or systems from which different piece parts can bereused across multiple subsystems and multiple applications.<p>

What are inheritance models?<s> The  objects  models are very similar to what we talkedabout earlier remember we talked about ER diagrams.<s> Object models are very similar toER diagrams; we are not going to go very much into that.<p>
