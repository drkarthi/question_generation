So what are some of the cause I mean why do these things come in is the question that weare going to ask ourselves naturally and the first thing is the stability of the team itself.Like I said there is some social  factors that come into play in this case and the  socialfactors essentially are that it is not very it is considered to be not very good to go into amaintenance job as  opposed  to a  development job  so the staff involved typically theturnover rate in the maintenance position is very high people tend to come in and if theyget  a  development opportunity they tend to leave or  migrate out of the group so  thestability of the team plays a very very important role in driving up maintenance cost.<s> Newpeople are coming in and they are taking a lot more time to understand the software as aresult of which  making a change and  as we see later a  large  percentage of time andmoney that goes towards making the change is spent on understanding the software itself.So,  making the actual change is a much smaller portion of the cause within this so thestability of the team is very very important in this case.<p>

Also  there is a throw it over the wall  kind of attitude.<s> Developers typically have nocontractual responsibility for maintaining the software so they build it and then they saywe have done with development let somebody else take care at this point in time and thatattitude would have to change as well.<s> So the skills of the various tasks involved clearly,the complexity of the system that exist, if it is a  very large system with high degree ofcoupling very many modules then obviously maintenance costs  are going to be highsomething like this.<s> If  the modularization itself is not done right then the cost ofmaintenance is going to be very high, if the architecture of the system is not right the costand maintenance are going to be high.<s> So, whatever is done during development is goingto have a significant impact on the cost of maintenance itself.<p>
