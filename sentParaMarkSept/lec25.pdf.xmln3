Now the change in the business process typically reflects would have to be reflected backin the systems that are now running this  service  industry.<s> So this is an example of  abusiness environment changing as the result of which you have to change something.Also there could be errors in the software that has just been put out.<s> So, for example, abutton was mislabeled that could be a simple error in the software all the way to complexlogic  errors that could occur.<s> Hopefully  this would have been readed  out during theprocess of software testing but no testing system is guaranteed to deliver software that iscompletely bug free as it is called in the software world and therefore these errors wouldhave to be repaired and that is another reason for software having to change; an algorithmmight have to change,  some code might have to change,  some interface might have tochange, some UI might have to change as a result of this and so on.<p>

Now it  could also be  that new equipment might have to be accommodated and a veryclassy  example of this is the change from the mainframe error where we  were buildingsoftware to run on very large servers down to the scenario today which is lots of cheapservers that on networked; the smaller cheaper servers that on networked to one anothercreating what is called distributed system so this can cause a change because it is muchcheaper to buy and maintain the smaller servers; the company might decide as a policy tomove to this new hardware architecture as a result of which software would also have tochange.<p>

Certainly the performance or  the reliability of the software may have to be improvedbecause as things start out and software has rolled out initially it could be that it was builtto be reliable  say 95 percent of the  time because that was enough to meet the businessneeds of the company at that point in time.<s> But as the company grows to rely more andmore  on the software  the  availability may have to be pushed up to the 99.9  percent ormore  which  is  what is being asked of today of  software  around  service companiestypically.<s> So all these reasons exist  for software changing and as the software changesdifferent kinds of changes take place within the software environment so there needs tobe some kind of a  coordinated process or a strategy to deal with this change and a keyproblem  that  has always been is  the process of managing change to  the legacy systemswithin this environment.<p>
