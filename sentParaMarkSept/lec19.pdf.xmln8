So cyclomatic complexity gives number of independent paths in the basis set or the basisset for these statement coverage, which has the very basic independent paths, so that eachpath covers at least one extra edge in the flow graph.<s> That means they are not redundantand  it gives upper bound on number of test that must be conducted  to ensure allstatements get covered at least once.<s> So, this could compute in the number of regions andin that you count the outer region also.<s> A number of predicate nodes plus 1, or you cancount it as number of edges minus number of vertices plus 2 and that is your number ofregions.<s> So,  you can see that cyclomatic complexity for this compound condition whichwe had just seen a couple of minutes ago can be computed here to be 3.<p>

If you look at this flow graph, we have a branching if a is true, we are going to executex, for that we are going to take upper path.<s> If a  is false  then, we will check if b  istrue, we will take the middle path and we will go by this x.<s> Else if b is not true, thenwe are going to take y, that means if a is not true and b is also not true, you take thebottom path and then we join here.<s> So,  we have this one region where  I am rolling themouse  and then this is the  middle region and you have the outer  region.<s> These threeregions give  you the count of number of regions  that  gives you the cyclomaticcomplexity.<s> We can calculate the number of predicate nodes plus 1.<s> You have one nodeS1  and another node  S2.<s> Hence,  we have two branches  and so the  number of predicatenode  plus  1  which is  2  plus  1  equal to 3.<s> Or the number of edges -  number of verticesplus 2:  So, how many edges are there?<s> We have seven edges and 6 vertices.<s> So, 7 minus6 plus 2 and you get 3.<p>
