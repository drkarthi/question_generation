One will say cost of conformance, what is the cost of conformance?<s> It is every money orevery penny that we spend to prevent from something going wrong.<s> It  is like theprevention  cost which  may include everything from setting standards  and selectingpeople and training them well, all these things will go in prevention cost.<s> Similarly youmight have appraisal cost.<s> Appraisal cost is after  making the product you plan that youwill go and review it or  test  it.<s> Remember the initiative is  your own, you  call it asconformance because  it  is the effort that we have planned  to make sure that too manymistakes  go past this particular stage.<s> So  anything  like measurements,  test equipmentcost, harnessing cost, all  the facilities,  resources  and  everything that you need forachieving quality basically and what you promise up front and deploy is basically cost ofconformance.<p>

Why this particular thing is important is because of lot of other costs called cost of non-conformance.<s> What is the cost of non-conformance?Every time a product fails or gets bounced off when it is not supposed to, this can happenwhile the job is yet to be delivered  to the customer or it can happen after the job isdelivered to the customer.<s> So in either of these particular cases if the product failurehappens in an unplanned manner not because of our initiative but it happens then we saythat this is a cost of non-conformance.<p>

Now remember,  the cost of non-conformance is very high.<s> Specially  if there is anexternal failure then imagine the cost of bringing a product down and bringing it back toa sight and rectifying it, sending back or sending a person from your team all the way tothe site and fixing that  particular product.<s> These  are very expensive activities, it  is notvery easy plus you have added things like loss of goodwill so external failure has to bereally feared in that particular sense.<s> You would like to aim to keep the external failuresto a minimum.<p>
