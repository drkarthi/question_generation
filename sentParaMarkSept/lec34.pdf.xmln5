Remember one most important particular dictum; the consequential cost of failure is veryhigh.<s> Now in this particular [31:49] we just mentioned  what is the differencebetween testing a product and  running it in real  life situation.<s> Actually  there is nodifference between the two except that when you are doing testing of a product there isno consequential cost of failure because even if the product was to fail it is not going tocost any subsequent  losses.<s> The losses are restricted to the failure itself.<s> So theconsequential cost from our particular point of view is to be feared.<p>

There are other ways in which you can classify the cost: One is stat-up cost.<s> The stat-upcosts are like setting up the policy, the standards and matrix identification and tools areall spent up front before the project starts.<s> Of course many of them are common to all theprojects that we may undertake.<s> Then we have project related costs.<p>

Project  related costs are making  a quality plan,  providing all the quality assurancesupport, then supervision for the cost, supervision is also very costly, then quality controlactivity is also costly so these are basically activities which we are performing during aparticular project.<s> And then there is the  continuous cost  where you have to haveoverheads the management, staff training, marinating the standards, standards is not a onetime activity, then during research metrics  management keeping the data acquiring,keeping and using that particular data.<s> So these are  all  the  particular aspects that fallunder cost of quality.<s> So it is possible for us to look at the cost of quality in more thanone side.<s> So we can now end up say that in case we had a quality planning process thetypical quality planning process will end up with four outputs.<p>

(Refer Slide Time: 34:03)<p>

As shown here in the slide the  first particular output is quality management plan.<s> Thequality management plan basically describes  as to how the project will implement thequality policy.<s> It  addresses  aspects like assurance, control, quality improvement and  soon and so forth.<s> So if you are doing something like ISO 9000 if the project quality systemis  consistent  with the expectations like the organizational  structure, the responsibilities,the process and then resources extra.<p>
