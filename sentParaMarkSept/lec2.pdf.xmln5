Then after we have built the prototype, we evaluate and refine.<s> And if necessary we goback and repeat this whole cycle.<s> When the evaluation leads to clearly definedrequirements, then we are ready to build the product.<s> And this is done using the standardengineering approach.<s> So product development takes place once the prototyping cyclesare gone through and we have come to a clearly defined requirements document for thefinal product.<s> Now there are of course some limitations to prototyping.<s> There aresituations where prototyping is ideal, but at the same time we need to be aware of theselimitations.<s> First the customer may be happy with the prototype itself and may demandthat the prototype be released for his operations or functions.This is not really appropriate because the prototype may work in the beginning for sometime, but it may not be maintainable.<s> It may not give the kind of performance and it maynot have the rugged design that is required for sustained operations.<s> The second problemcould be that the process of prototyping.<s> The developer gets so  attached to some of theapproach he has used, that he doesnt try to refine them or look for better way of buildingthe same functionality.<s> In that case we may actually have difficulties with the qualityperformance or other attributes of the software.<s> What it really means is that, we develop asome kind of blindness towards other possible techniques or better way of doing things,because  whatever  way we implemented something in the prototype,  we continue thesame in the product.<p>
