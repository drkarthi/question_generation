So the two modules which are not ready, we have put stubs in the driver.<s> M1 and M3 areready where as M2 and M4 are not ready.<s> They have been combined by this driver.<s> Soprobably you have an assembly line there or a sequence.<s> The data flows from M1 to M2,M2 to M3, and M3 to M4 and comes out of M4.<s> The input goes first to M1.<s> So you havea sequence of instructions or sequence of modules which are executed one after the other,output of one module is coupled to input another module and so on.<p>

In this particular sequence, M1 and M3 are ready but M2 and M4 are not ready.<s> Still youcan  complete the testing by the  stubs for the module which are not available and thedriver to combine all the modules,  to integrate all the modules,  to actually pass on theoutput of one to the input of another.<s> And the input identified in the entire test case forthe first module in this particular assembly  line.<s> So this is  one sequence or onepossibility.<s> There could be other structures in your module graphs and accordingly youhave to choose drivers and stubs whenever required.<p>

So the yellow ones are the stub modules and the green ones are the actual ready modules.We are able to do an integration testing with this partially complete system.<s> Two modulesare ready and two modules are not ready, but even if they are not ready we are going todevelop stubs for them.<s> The stubs are integrated along with the ready modules.<s> The readymodules  do not know that M2  and  M4  are not complete.<s> Because they still are able toaccept the input and give you some output.<s> That output from M2 is sent to M3.<s> One hasto write appropriate stubs for M2 and M4, so that you are able to test M1 and M3 as peryour test plan.<p>
