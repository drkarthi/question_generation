So functionally it should be acceptable to the user.<s> More over it should also be acceptablein terms of performance.<s> In a SRS document the performance criteria were also specified.So at this point the SRS  document will be used by the user to carry out the finalacceptance of the system.<s> Once the user has accepted the system we are ready to switchover.<s> The system can be installed.<s> And once the system is installed we are ready to usethe software in day-to-day operations.<s> The next phase which is the operations andmaintenance phase, we will ensure that the system will continue to meet the user needs.And in order to do this we may have to take up maintenance activities.<s> The maintenanceactivity consists of,  removing any errors that the user may find in the software,  orextending the present features in the software for new requirements that the user mayhave.<s> So we might make some extensions or we may even add entirely new features.<p>

Occasionally it may also be necessary to convert the software to run on new platforms ornew systems, because the software might have a fairly long life and during this time thehardware or the systems may change significantly and we may want to change theplatform of the software.<s> So these  are the maintenance activities and this generallycontinues throughout the lifecycle.<p>

Let us summarize the various phases we have carried out.<s> We have seen that there aredifferent phases and each phase has a well defined task and has a well defineddeliverables.<s> In many cases these deliverables have a standard format.<s> Now we have seenthat feasibility was  one of the important steps.<s> It establishes different alternatives andthese alternatives are analyzed for the cost effectiveness.<s> Requirement analysis is a veryimportant step and also very challenging where the analyst or the developer has toprepare the complete specifications for the software by meeting the users  and  by goingthrough the existing system if necessary.<s> So this is going to be the first baseline.<s> And wesaw that there is an  IEEE format which is very comprehensive and which defines thevarious aspects of the software which needs to be developed.<p>
