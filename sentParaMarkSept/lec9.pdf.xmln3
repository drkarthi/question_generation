Another requirement for a model is that it should capture the meaning of the data.Naturally we are trying to understand the data which is present in that real world,  andthen we are going to put it in the form of a suitable conceptual model.<s> This model shouldcapture the real world meaning of the data.<s> Otherwise it will be difficult to interpret thedata.<s> We have a notion of what we call data semantics.<s> Data semantics is concerned withthe meaning of the data how we  convey the meaning of data.<s> When you prepare a datamodel not only it should give us some techniques for representing the data but it shouldalso give us a way of conveying the meaning of the data.<p>

Both of these the concepts and the meanings what we generally call as syntax andsemantics would be important aspects of a data model.<s> How do we capture semanticshow do we convey the meaning of the data?<s> There may be different ways of doing thatand we will see that in the ER model the different methods are provided by which we canconvey the meaning of the data which we are modeling.<s> (Refer Slide Time: 12:46)<p>

Some of the ways that you will encounter are given here.<s> For example the proper namingof the data is important.<s> The name of the data itself conveys a lot of meaning.<s> If I tell youthat an item has a price, I use the word price for obviously indicating at what cost youcan purchase.<s> The word price has a specific meaning and by choosing the right word forthe right aspect of data, I am conveying that meaning.<p>

In fact the most important aspect of conveying the meaning of data is proper naming.This is what we must keep in mind when we are building a data model.<s> The differenttypes of data that we will define or the different representations that we will choose areall named very meaningfully and also named in the context of the business environmentwhich we are modeling.<s> Anybody who has the familiarity with that business environmentwill quickly understand what data we are talking about and what role it has in the realworld.<p>
