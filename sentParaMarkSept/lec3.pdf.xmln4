In fact the difference between the existing system and proposed system has to be clearlyworked out.<s> And this would depend not only on the users requirements,  but it wouldbenefit from the experience of the analyst,  the innovations that he  can suggest in theexisting processes.<s> So that the proposed system will effectively solve the problems whichwere felt by the user and which has initiated this whole project.<s> So the proposed system isnot just a duplication of the existing system.<s> We are not only changing the way the thingsare done today, but we may even extend the scope of the system.We may even suggest the new tasks, new functions, and new outputs from the system.<s> Sothis would depend on the vision and the experience of both the users in terms of whatthey need,  in order to solve their business problems effectively  and the experience andthe vision of the developer or analyst who is assisting the user in identifying therequirements.<p>

So naturally this would include new needs of the users.<s> The proposed systems wouldimprove the work flows, it might do some business process reengineering, and it will tryto introduce efficiency and more effectiveness in the way things are done at present.<s> Soidea is to prepare the data flow diagram for the proposed system.<s> This proposed systemwill become the basis for software implementations subsequently.<s> Once this proposedsystem is clearly defined in terms of its inputs, processing and outputs, then we are readyto develop or to prepare  the documentation for this particular phase.<s> This  results in thepreparation of what is called the Software Requirements Specification Document.<p>

Now we will now look at the format of the requirement specification document.<s> It is veryimportant to understand this clearly, because this is one of the very important documents.As we said earlier it becomes a baseline for a contract between the user and thedeveloper.<s> It is expected to contain the complete requirements which are adequate to tellthe user what he would get from the software.<s> And it is also adequate to tell the designersand developers subsequently for the complete implementation of the software solution.So let us understand the documentation format which has been standardized by IEEE.<p>

This is the format that we are discussing is as per the recommendations given by theIEEE organization, which has made lot of recommendations for software standardization.We will study the different sections, which this document will consist of.<s> The first sectionis the introduction section.<s> It first establishes the purpose of this document; what exactlyis the purpose and what is covered in this document?<p>
